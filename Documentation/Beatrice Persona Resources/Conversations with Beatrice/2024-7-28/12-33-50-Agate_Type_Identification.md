What type of agate is this?

## ASSISTANT
The agate in your photos appears to be a type of banded agate, possibly a variety known as "moss agate" or "jasper agate." The combination of the red, black, and translucent areas suggests a mixed composition, which is common in these types of agates.

Moss agates typically feature inclusions that resemble moss, trees, or other foliage, created by minerals like manganese or iron. Jasper agates, on the other hand, are often more opaque with a range of colors due to various impurities.

To get a more accurate identification, consider these steps:
1. **Inspect Under a Light**: Check the stone under a bright light to see the banding patterns more clearly.
2. **Hardness Test**: Agates typically have a hardness of 7 on the Mohs scale.
3. **Consult a Professional**: For precise identification, you might want to consult a gemologist or take the stone to a geological institution.

If you'd like a more detailed identification, providing additional photos or consulting a local expert can be very helpful.

## ASSISTANT
The new set of photos provides a clearer view of the stone. Based on the characteristics visible in the images, the agate appears to be a type of "banded agate" or possibly "plume agate." The features that suggest this include:

1. **Color Patterns**: The stone exhibits a mix of translucent, red, black, and white areas, which are typical of agates with banding and inclusions.
2. **Inclusions**: The black areas and the red streaks suggest it could be plume agate, which often contains inclusions that resemble plumes or feathers.
3. **Translucency**: The stone has translucent areas, which is a common trait in many agate varieties.

### Potential Identification: Plume Agate
- **Plume Agate**: Known for its feather-like inclusions, which can be black, red, or other colors. The inclusions often create patterns that are visually distinctive and highly valued among collectors.

### Confirming Identification
To confirm the type of agate, you can consider:
- **Expert Analysis**: Take the stone to a gemologist or a geological institution for precise identification.
- **Comparative Analysis**: Compare your stone to known samples of plume agate or other banded agates to see if the patterns match.
- **Mineral Hardness Test**: As agates typically have a hardness of 7 on the Mohs scale, a simple scratch test can help confirm its identity.

If you need further assistance or more detailed identification, I recommend consulting a professional in the field.
