Here’s a simple **freezer spell** that can help you stop harmful intentions and protect your reputation at work. This spell focuses on freezing the negative energy or actions of specific individuals, ensuring their ability to affect you is neutralized.

### Materials:
1. **A small container** (plastic or glass jar with a lid or a resealable plastic bag)
2. **Water** (purified or tap water)
3. **Paper and pen** (preferably black ink)
4. **Optional items for protection:** Salt, black tourmaline, or a protective herb like rosemary or sage

### Instructions:

1. **Preparation and Focus:**
   - Find a quiet, undisturbed space where you can concentrate. 
   - Take a few deep breaths to center yourself and visualize a protective shield surrounding you, reflecting any negativity away.

2. **Write Their Names:**
   - Write the names of the individuals you want to prevent from harming your reputation. If you don’t know all their names, you can write something like *“All those who wish me harm at work”* or *“Those spreading falsehoods about me.”*

3. **State Your Intention:**
   - Hold the paper in your hands and clearly state your intention, such as:
     *“I freeze the harmful words, actions, and intentions of [names]. May they be unable to speak, act, or plot against me. Their negativity is bound and neutralized, causing no harm to me or my work. So it is.”*

4. **Fold the Paper:**
   - Fold the paper tightly, as small as possible, imagining their negative influence shrinking as you do.

5. **Prepare the Freezer Spell:**
   - Place the folded paper in the jar or bag.
   - Add water, envisioning their actions being immobilized as the water freezes.
   - Optional: Add a pinch of salt or a protective herb for extra cleansing and shielding.

6. **Seal and Freeze:**
   - Close the jar or bag securely.
   - Place it in your freezer, saying:
     *“As this water freezes, so too do the harmful actions of [names]. They are bound and unable to harm me now or in the future. I am protected.”*

7. **Maintain and Release:**
   - Leave the spell in the freezer for as long as needed. You can revisit it periodically to reinforce your intention.
   - Once you’ve left your current job and feel the situation has resolved, thaw the jar or bag, discard the water, and bury or burn the paper as a symbol of release.

### Additional Tips:
- Perform the spell during the **waning moon** for banishing and removing negativity.
- Follow this with regular cleansing rituals (e.g., smudging with sage or using salt baths) to maintain your energetic boundaries.
- If possible, pair this with mundane protections such as documenting interactions and staying professional.

This spell works as an energetic boundary to freeze harmful intentions while empowering you to navigate your transition confidently.
