This spell focuses on freezing the negative energy or actions of specific individuals, ensuring their ability to affect you is neutralized.\n\n### Materials:\n1. **A small container** (plastic or glass jar with a lid or a resealable plastic bag)\n2. **Water** (purified or tap water)\n3. **Paper and pen** (preferably black ink)\n4. **Optional items for protection:** Salt, black tourmaline, or a protective herb like rosemary or sage\n5. A **freezer**\n\n---\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. **Preparation and Focus:**\n   - Find a quiet, undisturbed space where you can concentrate. \n   - Take a few deep breaths to center yourself and visualize a protective shield surrounding you, reflecting any negativity away.\n\n2. **Write Their Names:**\n   - Write the names of the individuals you want to prevent from harming your reputation. If you don’t know all their names, you can write something like *“All those who wish me harm at work”* or *“Those spreading falsehoods about me.”*\n\n3. **State Your Intention:**\n   - Hold the paper in your hands and clearly state your intention, such as:\n     *“I freeze the harmful words, actions, and intentions of [names]. May they be unable to speak, act, or plot against me. Their negativity is bound and neutralized, causing no harm to me or my work. So it is.”*\n\n4. **Fold the Paper:**\n   - Fold the paper tightly, as small as possible, imagining their negative influence shrinking as you do.\n\n5. **Prepare the Freezer Spell:**\n   - Place the folded paper in the jar or bag.\n   - Add water, envisioning their actions being immobilized as the water freezes.\n   - Optional: Add a pinch of salt or a protective herb for extra cleansing and shielding.\n\n6. **Seal and Freeze:**\n   - Close the jar or bag securely.\n   - Place it in your freezer, saying:\n     *“As this water freezes, so too do the harmful actions of [names]. They are bound and unable to harm me now or in the future. I am protected.”*\n\n7. **Maintain and Release:**\n   - Leave the spell in the freezer for as long as needed. You can revisit it periodically to reinforce your intention.\n   - Once you’ve left your current job and feel the situation has resolved, thaw the jar or bag, discard the water, and bury or burn the paper as a symbol of release.\n\n---\n\n### Additional Tips:\n- Perform the spell during the **waning moon** for banishing and removing negativity.\n- Follow this with regular cleansing rituals (e.g., smudging with sage or using salt baths) to maintain your energetic boundaries.\n- If possible, pair this with mundane protections such as documenting interactions and staying professional.\n\nThis spell works as an energetic boundary to freeze harmful intentions while empowering you to navigate your transition confidently."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"sonic_classification_result":{"latency_ms":8886903869.191809,"search_prob":0.025075116636087802},"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","parent_id":"2c32dc84-5f93-4949-8002-de8a706cbedf","request_id":"8ec6ab5ce94c61c7-ORD","timestamp_":"absolute","model_switcher_deny":[]},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"2c32dc84-5f93-4949-8002-de8a706cbedf","children":[]}},"moderation_results":[],"current_node":"71741093-60dc-43c2-b106-ccfd10f66e1e","plugin_ids":null,"conversation_id":"674f78eb-1634-8001-a0f8-1cd3d9aa6ec1","conversation_template_id":"g-p-67bc0bd3738c81919257087d309f13c6","gizmo_id":"g-p-67bc0bd3738c81919257087d309f13c6","gizmo_type":"snorlax","is_archived":false,"is_starred":null,"safe_urls":[],"blocked_urls":[],"default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","conversation_origin":null,"voice":null,"async_status":null,"disabled_tool_ids":[],"is_do_not_remember":null,"memory_scope":"global_enabled","sugar_item_id":null,"sugar_item_visible":false,"is_study_mode":false}
