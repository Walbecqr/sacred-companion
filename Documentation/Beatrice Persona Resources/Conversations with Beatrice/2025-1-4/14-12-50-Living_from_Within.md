If time and money were no object, what would you do?







In her thought-provoking TED Talk, “2 Questions to Uncover Your Passion—and Turn It Into a Career,” Noeline Kirabo invites us to reflect on two transformative questions:







1️⃣ If unlimited time and resources were at your disposal, how would you spend your days?



2️⃣ What activities bring you the greatest happiness and fulfillment?







At first glance, these questions seem simple. But their true power lies in their ability to challenge us to look inward—beyond societal expectations and external measures of success.







Kirabo’s profound insight resonates deeply:







"You never truly start living until you learn to live from the inside out. And in unlocking potential, we need to look inward to identify the things that give us a deep sense of fulfillment, the things that give us the deepest joy, and then weave them into the patterns of our daily routines. In so doing, we cease to work and we start to live."







Imagine designing a life where your passions shape your daily routines—where your work feels like a natural extension of your deepest joys. This isn’t just about career choices; it’s about redefining what it means to live a fulfilled life.







If these questions spark curiosity or inspire reflection, I encourage you to watch Kirabo’s TED Talk! It’s a powerful reminder that the answers to living a purpose-driven life often reside within us, waiting to be uncovered.
