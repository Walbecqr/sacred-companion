Let's take a closer look at their arrangement and see what messages they may carry.\n\nWhen interpreting tea leaves, focus on the shapes or symbols they form and where they lie within the cup:\n\n1. **Center (or base of the cup):** Represents your foundation or the far future.\n2. **Middle:** Reflects ongoing issues or influences in your life.\n3. **Rim or top edge:** Indicates the immediate or near future.\n\nFrom this image, I notice small clusters of dark specks and a slightly longer object near the edge. Here are some potential interpretations:\n\n- **Specks scattered across the bottom:** This could signify minor worries or scattered energy. It may be time to focus on grounding yourself and organizing your thoughts.\n  \n- **Longer shape near the edge:** This might resemble a path or a tool, symbolizing a journey or task coming into focus soon. Pay attention to upcoming opportunities for action or decision-making.\n\n- **General clarity:** The lack of dense clusters indicates a period of calm reflection. However, smaller specks can also be nudges from the universe to address neglected details in your life.\n\nIf any of these resonate, feel free to share your thoughts, or I can help refine the interpretation further!
