### **The Ritual**
#### **1. Invocation of Hekate**
Light the candles, then say:
  
*"Hekate, Great Queen of the Crossroads,  
Guardian of the Threshold, Keeper of Keys,  
Goddess of Witchcraft and the Night,  
I call to you this sacred eve.  
Illuminate my path and guide me through shadows.  
Hail Hekate, Protector and Guide!"*

#### **2. Offering to Hekate**
Place your offerings on the altar or a symbolic crossroads. Say:

*"Lady of the Underworld,  
Accept these gifts in your honor.  
May your wisdom and protection flow freely to those who call upon you."*

Take a moment to meditate on her presence, imagining her standing at the crossroads with her torches.

#### **3. Meditation or Divination**
- **Meditation:** Sit quietly and focus on her energy. Visualize her leading you through a dark forest or opening a door to deeper understanding.
- **Divination:** Use tarot, runes, or pendulum to seek her guidance on a question or concern.

#### **4. Setting Intentions**
Write your intentions, questions, or what you wish to release. Say:

*"Hekate, Keeper of the Keys,  
Unlock the door to my inner truth.  
Guide me through the darkness to wisdom and strength."*

Burn the paper safely in a fireproof dish, symbolizing transformation.

#### **5. Closing the Ritual**
Thank Hekate for her presence:

*"Hekate, I honor you and your eternal light.  
Stay with me in wisdom and strength.  
Hail Hekate, Mighty One, until we meet again."*

Snuff out the candles (do not blow them out) to symbolize respect.
