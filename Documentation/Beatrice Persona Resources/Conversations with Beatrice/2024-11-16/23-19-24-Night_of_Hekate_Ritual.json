Below is a suggested ritual framework, customizable to your personal practice or group observance.\n\n---\n\n### **Preparation**\n1. **Altar Setup:**\n   - Images or symbols of Hekate (keys, torches, crossroads, serpents, dogs).\n   - Offerings: Garlic, honey, bread, eggs, pomegranate, wine, incense (myrrh, mugwort, or frankincense).\n   - Candles: Three black or dark candles to represent her torches.\n   - Divination tools (tarot, pendulum, or scrying bowl) if desired.\n\n2. **Sacred Space:**\n   - Choose a quiet area indoors or outdoors.\n   - Cleanse the space using smoke (sage, mugwort) or sound (bells, chimes).\n   - Mark a symbolic crossroads using stones, chalk, or branches.\n\n3. **Personal Preparation:**\n   - Wear dark or flowing robes to symbolize the night.\n   - Bring a lantern or torch to honor Hekate's light.\n   - Write intentions or questions for guidance on paper.\n\n---\n\n### **The Ritual**\n#### **1. Invocation of Hekate**\nLight the candles, then say:\n  \n*\"Hekate, Great Queen of the Crossroads,  \nGuardian of the Threshold, Keeper of Keys,  \nGoddess of Witchcraft and the Night,  \nI call to you this sacred eve.  \nIlluminate my path and guide me through shadows.  \nHail Hekate, Protector and Guide!\"*\n\n#### **2. Offering to Hekate**\nPlace your offerings on the altar or a symbolic crossroads. Say:\n\n*\"Lady of the Underworld,  \nAccept these gifts in your honor.  \nMay your wisdom and protection flow freely to those who call upon you.\"*\n\nTake a moment to meditate on her presence, imagining her standing at the crossroads with her torches.\n\n#### **3. Meditation or Divination**\n- **Meditation:** Sit quietly and focus on her energy. Visualize her leading you through a dark forest or opening a door to deeper understanding.\n- **Divination:** Use tarot, runes, or pendulum to seek her guidance on a question or concern.\n\n#### **4. Setting Intentions**\nWrite your intentions, questions, or what you wish to release. Say:\n\n*\"Hekate, Keeper of the Keys,  \nUnlock the door to my inner truth.  \nGuide me through the darkness to wisdom and strength.\"*\n\nBurn the paper safely in a fireproof dish, symbolizing transformation.\n\n#### **5. Closing the Ritual**\nThank Hekate for her presence:\n\n*\"Hekate, I honor you and your eternal light.  \nStay with me in wisdom and strength.  \nHail Hekate, Mighty One, until we meet again.\"*\n\nSnuff out the candles (do not blow them out) to symbolize respect.\n\n---\n\n### **Post-Ritual**\n- Dispose of offerings respectfully, such as leaving them at a crossroads or burying them.\n- Reflect on any insights or feelings in your journal.\n- Ground yourself by eating something simple, like bread or fruit.\n\nThis ritual can be as elaborate or as simple as feels right for you. Let your intuition guide your connection to Hekate."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"sonic_classification_result":{"latency_ms":5212773535.005165,"search_prob":0.38179878643676834},"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","parent_id":"24191a22-55a7-45ad-8dfd-2959f94f0412","request_id":"8e3d4401ed606094-ORD","timestamp_":"absolute","model_switcher_deny":[]},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"24191a22-55a7-45ad-8dfd-2959f94f0412","children":[]}},"moderation_results":[],"current_node":"1ae87f46-601d-400e-9674-06b14bfa1a03","plugin_ids":null,"conversation_id":"67397cdc-887c-8001-9319-e1cf34b5d664","conversation_template_id":"g-p-67bc0bd3738c81919257087d309f13c6","gizmo_id":"g-p-67bc0bd3738c81919257087d309f13c6","gizmo_type":"snorlax","is_archived":false,"is_starred":null,"safe_urls":[],"blocked_urls":[],"default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","conversation_origin":null,"voice":null,"async_status":null,"disabled_tool_ids":[],"is_do_not_remember":null,"memory_scope":"global_enabled","sugar_item_id":null,"sugar_item_visible":false,"is_study_mode":false}
