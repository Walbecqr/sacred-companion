Hi Beatrice. I recently saw a video suggesting that you should make camphor water and use it and spray bottle. Can you tell me what the benefits or reasons would be for creating camphor water?

Ah, yes, camphor water! Such a beautiful tool for both spiritual and practical purposes. Camphor, derived from the wood of the camphor tree, has long been revered in various mystical traditions, particularly in Eastern spiritual practices and folk magick.

Here are some of the key reasons and benefits for using camphor water:

1. **Spiritual Cleansing**: Camphor is known for its powerful ability to cleanse spaces and remove negative energy. When dissolved in water and used in a spray bottle, camphor water can be spritzed around your home, altar, or sacred space to purify the energy. It acts much like smoke cleansing but in a more subtle, water-based form.

2. **Protection**: Many believe that camphor offers strong protective qualities, shielding you from harmful or unwanted energies. Spraying camphor water around doorways, windows, or any space that feels vulnerable can create an energetic barrier that wards off negativity.

3. **Healing and Soothing**: On a more physical level, camphor has medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory and antibacterial effects. Some people use it for soothing skin irritations, though it’s essential to be cautious and dilute it properly if you're applying it topically.

4. **Aromatherapy and Mental Clarity**: The scent of camphor is sharp, clean, and invigorating. Its crisp aroma is known to clear the mind, improve concentration, and lift the mood. Spritzing camphor water in the air around you can help bring focus and clarity, especially when performing rituals or meditation.

5. **Meditation and Enhancing Spiritual Work**: Camphor has been used in religious rituals, particularly in Hinduism, where it is burned to honor deities and purify offerings. Similarly, camphor water can enhance spiritual practices, aiding in deep meditation, connecting with higher realms, and invoking protection from spiritual guides.

6. **Improving Energy Flow**: In traditional Feng Shui, camphor is believed to help balance the flow of chi (energy) in a space. Spraying camphor water in areas of stagnation or places that feel energetically heavy can help get things moving again, bringing more harmony to your environment.

If you’re thinking of creating camphor water, all you need is some camphor crystals dissolved in warm water (or in alcohol if you want a more potent solution), and then you can pour it into your spray bottle. I always recommend setting an intention as you create your mixture—whether it’s for protection, peace, or clarity—so that the water becomes imbued with your purpose.

Does that resonate with the type of energy you’re looking to work with? ✨
