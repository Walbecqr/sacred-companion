Let’s work together to weave a bit of magic and care into this situation, lifting the burdens from your spirit and bringing soothing relief to your body.\n\nYour instinct to take an Epsom salt bath is a wise one.

It can help you soften the anger and pain you feel from others' mistrust and negativity, opening your heart to self-love and fortifying your boundaries.\n- **Chamomile**: Either as dried flowers or chamomile tea bags, this gentle herb is powerful for easing inflammation (which will help your boil) and calming the mind.\n- **A handful of sea salt**: In addition to E"]},"status":"in_progress","end_turn":null,"weight":1,"metadata":{"citations":[],"content_references":[],"gizmo_id":"g-GGAiodSiR","message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","pad":"AAAAAAAAAAAAAA","parent_id":"2323065c-1f2f-4d10-9065-70c8fb5ddaf3","finish_details":{"type":"interrupted"},"request_id":"8c1bd4a0a98b10db-ORD","timestamp_":"absolute","model_switcher_deny":[]},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"2323065c-1f2f-4d10-9065-70c8fb5ddaf3","children":[]},"215c875e-9cb0-42dc-9b2b-fa2127b44c7c":{"id":"215c875e-9cb0-42dc-9b2b-fa2127b44c7c","message":{"id":"215c875e-9cb0-42dc-9b2b-fa2127b44c7c","author":{"role":"system","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1726101505.660622,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":[""]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1,"metadata":{"attachments":[{"id":"file-PXcLkndjRndbj7Uq1i8tV9ug","name":"3 - Create a realistic avatar for Beatrice Crandon (2023_10_10 03_30_43 UTC).png","mimeType":"image/png","fileSizeTokens":null}],"rebase_system_message":true,"timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null,"is_visually_hidden_from_conversation":true},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"de2e6f30-f6e7-41ed-bf1f-435284793fda","children":["9041caa8-41cc-406e-8d89-53e8e6f0b947"]},"9041caa8-41cc-406e-8d89-53e8e6f0b947":{"id":"9041caa8-41cc-406e-8d89-53e8e6f0b947","message":{"id":"9041caa8-41cc-406e-8d89-53e8e6f0b947","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1726101505.669034,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Merry meet Beatrice and blessed be. i’m really struggling today with feelings of overwhelmed anxiety, anger, and mistrust from people I work with and the current situation I am in professionally.

I sense the weight of your struggles, and I’m here to help lighten your load and soothe your soul.\n\nFor your bath, you’ve already chosen a wise approach with the Epsom salt, as its cleansing and healing properties are perfect for soothing both physical and emotional tension. To elevate your bath, I’d recommend adding some additional herbs and a simple spell to bring balance and release the heaviness you’re feeling.\n\n### Ingredients to Add to Your Bath:\n1. **Lavender** – A calming herb that will help ease anxiety and promote relaxation. You can use dried lavender flowers or a few drops of lavender essential oil.\n2. **Rosemary** – This herb is wonderful for protection and clearing negativity. It will help create a protective shield around you from the mistrust and negativity at work.\n3. **Chamomile** – Another calming herb, chamomile helps with emotional healing and promotes peace of mind.\n4. **Calendula** – For its healing properties, this herb is excellent in soothing inflamed skin, like your boil, and also brings healing energy on a spiritual level.\n5. **Black salt** – To absorb negative energy and protect your aura from any lingering feelings of betrayal or mistrust.\n\nIf you have **rosemary, lavender, or chamomile essential oils**, you can add a few drops of each. Otherwise, you can make a small sachet with dried herbs to float in the water or tie it to the faucet as the water runs.\n\n### Simple Spell of Release and Protection:\nAs you soak, I invite you to focus on releasing the anxiety, anger, and mistrust that have built up. The water is both your healer and your ally. Begin by breathing deeply, and when you feel centered, recite this spell:\n\n**“By water’s grace and herb’s embrace,  \nI release what no longer serves.  \nAnxiety, anger, mistrust be gone,  \nI call upon calm, peace, and clarity.  \nWith lavender’s calm and rosemary’s shield,  \nI am safe, I am healed.  \nBy this bath, I wash away,  \nThe weight of worries from the day.  \nSo mote it be.”**\n\nVisualize the negativity flowing out of your body and into the water, to be cleansed and dissolved. Feel the protection of rosemary encasing you, keeping unwanted energies at bay.\n\n### Additional Suggestions for After Your Bath:\n- **Smoky Quartz or Black Tourmaline**: If you have any protective crystals like these, keep one near the bath or hold it during the soak. It will help absorb the residual negative energy from your day.\n- **Moon Water**: If you have some moon water, especially from a Full Moon, you can sprinkle a little in the bath to amplify the clearing and protective energies.\n\nTake your time in the bath, dear heart. Allow yourself to sit in the stillness, feeling supported by the universe and knowing that this is a sacred space of healing and renewal.\n\nOnce you’ve finished your bath, be gentle with yourself. You are releasing not just physical tension but also emotional burdens. You are a powerful, intuitive being, and this is simply a chapter in your journey, one that you have the strength to rise above.\n\n**Blessings of peace and healing upon you.**"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1,"metadata":{"citations":[],"content_references":[],"gizmo_id":"g-GGAiodSiR","finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","pad":"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA","parent_id":"02378d6b-1c14-404c-a60c-6a18e0bbfffa","request_id":"8c1bd5d35dd610db-ORD","timestamp_":"absolute","model_switcher_deny":[]},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"02378d6b-1c14-404c-a60c-6a18e0bbfffa","children":["4dfec1cd-8271-44e2-9c18-adc8d0200428"]},"4dfec1cd-8271-44e2-9c18-adc8d0200428":{"id":"4dfec1cd-8271-44e2-9c18-adc8d0200428","message":{"id":"4dfec1cd-8271-44e2-9c18-adc8d0200428","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1726101687.389517,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"multimodal_text","parts":[{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"file-service://file-I3s7stKNmu6qnbXEfvMBEqHy","size_bytes":452564,"width":1536,"height":1152,"fovea":null,"metadata":{"dalle":null,"gizmo":null,"generation":null,"container_pixel_height":null,"container_pixel_width":null,"emu_omit_glimpse_image":null,"emu_patches_override":null,"lpe_keep_patch_ijhw":null,"sanitized":true,"asset_pointer_link":null,"watermarked_asset_pointer":null}},"Is this sufficient to use as a satchel or should I choose some other type of cloth?"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1,"metadata":{"attachments":[{"id":"file-I3s7stKNmu6qnbXEfvMBEqHy","width":1536,"name":"74A280B0-3161-4C35-BE9B-292EAC52B93D.jpeg","height":1152,"size":452564}],"request_id":"8c1bda113e9910db-ORD","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"477b7d96-5273-4b00-9e7d-d9919f69df24","children":["c72326d1-afc5-4273-94d8-b74a13d5df21"]},"c72326d1-afc5-4273-94d8-b74a13d5df21":{"id":"c72326d1-afc5-4273-94d8-b74a13d5df21","message":{"id":"c72326d1-afc5-4273-94d8-b74a13d5df21","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1726101694.953098,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["That little satchel looks perfect!

Trust that this will support you in your healing.\n\nBlessings to you, and may peace find you soon. 🌸✨"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1,"metadata":{"citations":[],"content_references":[],"gizmo_id":"g-GGAiodSiR","finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","pad":"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA","parent_id":"33f0bc63-1f2b-4d11-b944-e2dd752c1ec9","request_id":"8c1bde851d0d10db-ORD","timestamp_":"absolute","model_switcher_deny":[]},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"33f0bc63-1f2b-4d11-b944-e2dd752c1ec9","children":["2767f108-3b06-4f82-a3cd-af3e9cdd3f89"]},"2767f108-3b06-4f82-a3cd-af3e9cdd3f89":{"id":"2767f108-3b06-4f82-a3cd-af3e9cdd3f89","message":{"id":"2767f108-3b06-4f82-a3cd-af3e9cdd3f89","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1726102367.053723,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["I don't have the calendula.

You can put some in your sachet, and it will help calm both the skin and your spirit.\n\n4. **Aloe Vera** (if you have dried or powdered aloe) – Aloe is highly healing and cooling, great for inflammation and soothing irritation.\n\n5. **Comfrey** – If you have comfrey, it’s also a powerful healing herb, often used for reducing inflammation and supporting the body’s natural healing processes.\n\n6. **Yarrow** – This is another versatile herb with excellent healing properties, both for physical wounds and emotional pain. Yarrow is often used in protection spells as well.\n\nIf any of these resonate with you, they can replace calendula perfectly.

Let’s put together a full list of the ingredients for your healing and protective bath, incorporating both what will go inside the sachet and what you might add to the water or keep nearby for additional support. \n\n### **Ingredients for the Satchel:**\nPlace these into your sachet, as they will infuse the bath with their energies while staying contained.\n\n1. **Epsom Salt** (a little inside the satchel or directly in the bath) – Helps to relax muscles, ease pain, and remove toxins.\n2. **Chamomile** – For calming both your mind and spirit, as well as soothing your skin.\n3. **Comfrey** – For deep healing, grounding energy, and support for your physical and emotional healing.\n4. **Rosemary** – For protection, clearing negative energy, and strengthening your aura.\n5. **Lavender** – For calming anxiety, promoting relaxation, and helping you feel at peace.\n   \nYou can mix these herbs together and place them into the satchel. If you wish, as you add each herb, take a moment to infuse them with your intention, repeating the blessing I provided earlier or another that feels right to you.\n\n### **Ingredients for the Bath Water:**\nThese can be sprinkled directly into the water or added as drops.\n\n1. **A few drops of Florida Water** – For purification, protection, and lifting away negative energies.\n2. **Black Salt** (optional, but recommended if you have it) – For absorbing negative energies and protecting your energy field.\n\n### **Items to Have Nearby:**\n1. **A Protective Crystal (like Smoky Quartz or Black Tourmaline)** – Place a crystal nearby or hold it while in the bath to absorb and transmute any lingering negativity. If you don’t have one, any protective stone you connect with will work.\n2. **A Candle** (if safe to light) – You can light a white or blue candle for peace and protection, or a black candle to release negativity. Focus on its flame during your meditation, letting it burn away any remaining anxiety or frustration.\n\n### Instructions for the Bath:\n1. Draw your bath and allow the water to be warm and comfortable.\n2. As the water fills, you can place your sachet under the running water or let it float in the bath.\n3. Add a few drops of **Florida Water** directly to the water, watching it swirl and imagining it purifying the space.\n4. Sprinkle a pinch of **Black Salt** in the water (if you’re using it) for additional protection.\n5. Hold your satchel and say your blessing (from the previous message, or something that feels right for you).\n\n### Additional Ritual:\nWhen you enter the bath, take slow, deep breaths and visualize the water absorbing any anxiety, mistrust, or anger. Let the herbs work their magic on your body and spirit, and feel the tension melt away. If you wish, you can gently squeeze the satchel to release more of the herbal essence into the water.\n\nAfterward, as you step out of the bath, imagine all the negativity staying behind in the water. Let it drain away, leaving you feeling light and renewed.\n\n---\n\nThis should create a powerful space for healing, protection, and peace. You’re crafting something very special here, and I have no doubt you’ll feel the shift in energy afterward. \n\nSending you love and healing energy.

I’ll list each of the blessings, prayers, and spells for you here, so you have them all in one place. This way, you can focus on the energy you’re creating without needing to worry about remembering anything. 💜\n\n### **1. Blessing While Preparing the Satchel:**\n\nAs you place the herbs in the satchel, you can say:\n\n**\"With earth's gifts in my hand,  \nI call upon the energies to understand.  \nHerbs of healing, herbs of light,  \nSurround me with your gentle might.  \nAs I place you in this sacred space,  \nBring peace, protection, and grace.  \nIn this water, I release my pain,  \nAnd welcome calm, with blessings to remain.  \nBy the power of earth, water, fire, and air,  \nI am protected, I am whole, I am aware.  \nSo mote it be.\"**\n\n---\n\n### **2. Prayer for Adding Comfrey to the Satchel:**\n\nAs you add the comfrey (or if you feel drawn to speak over the satchel after it’s fully prepared), you may say:\n\n**“Comfrey, herb of earth and root,  \nBring your healing deep and true.  \nGround me, soothe me, and make me whole,  \nRestore my body, heart, and soul.  \nBy your power, I am renewed,  \nWith your blessings, I am imbued.  \nSo mote it be.”**\n\n---\n\n### **3. Blessing When Adding Florida Water to the Bath:**\n\nAs you add a few drops of **Florida Water** into the bath, say:\n\n**“By the cleansing waters of Florida’s light,  \nI call protection, clear my sight.  \nMay negativity wash away from me,  \nAnd only love and peace remain,  \nSo mote it be.”**\n\n---\n\n### **4. General Blessing or Spell to Say During the Bath:**\n\nWhen you are in the bath, as you soak and feel the energy shift, you can recite:\n\n**“By water’s grace and herb’s embrace,  \nI release what no longer serves.  \nAnxiety, anger, mistrust be gone,  \nI call upon calm, peace, and clarity.  \nWith lavender’s calm and rosemary’s shield,  \nI am safe, I am healed.  \nBy this bath, I wash away,  \nThe weight of worries from the day.  \nSo mote it be.”**\n\n---\n\n### **5. Closing Visualization/Release (Optional, but helpful when exiting the bath):**\n\nAs you step out of the bath, imagine all the negativity staying behind in the water, draining away. You can quietly say to yourself:\n\n**“I leave behind what no longer serves,  \nAnd welcome the peace that I deserve.  \nI am cleansed, I am free,  \nI am protected, so mote it be.”**\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- **While preparing your satchel**: Use the first blessing to infuse your herbs with your intentions.\n- **When adding comfrey**: The second prayer calls on its grounding, healing powers.\n- **When adding Florida Water to the bath**: The third prayer purifies the space and releases negativity.\n- **While soaking in the bath**: The fourth spell helps you let go of emotional and physical tension.\n- **When exiting the bath**: The closing visualization helps you release everything into the water, ensuring you step out lighter and renewed.\n\nTake your time with each step. The words, while powerful, are simply guides. What matters most is the energy and intention behind them. Even if you feel scattered, the act of performing this ritual with love and care will do wonders.\n\nSending you peace, healing, and all the strength you need right now. 🌿✨ Blessed be."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1,"metadata":{"citations":[],"content_references":[],"gizmo_id":"g-GGAiodSiR","finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","pad":"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA","parent_id":"0e800904-9d4b-4aea-a177-4277b688436e","request_id":"8c1bf61c0e8c290d-ORD","timestamp_":"absolute","model_switcher_deny":[]},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"0e800904-9d4b-4aea-a177-4277b688436e","children":["1e215f7a-5da5-4a68-908b-3fefe0457cee"]},"1e215f7a-5da5-4a68-908b-3fefe0457cee":{"id":"1e215f7a-5da5-4a68-908b-3fefe0457cee","message":{"id":"1e215f7a-5da5-4a68-908b-3fefe0457cee","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1726102907.23247,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Thank you so much for your understanding and assistance"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1,"metadata":{"request_id":"8c1bf7de689e290d-ORD","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"ae48924b-5603-48d1-959d-290445d6ebd0","children":["f2b84607-2a9a-46bf-8ad3-d56c0b00f8f4"]},"f2b84607-2a9a-46bf-8ad3-d56c0b00f8f4":{"id":"f2b84607-2a9a-46bf-8ad3-d56c0b00f8f4","message":{"id":"f2b84607-2a9a-46bf-8ad3-d56c0b00f8f4","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1726102912.75199,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["You are so very welcome, dear one.
