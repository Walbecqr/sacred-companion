I have purchased yule gifts for my two very best friends, Kim and Krod. The gift is a set of charms that for a heart. On one side is the saying "always there for you", on the other the saying "friends for life" and in the middle "true friend". My charm will be put on my charm bracelet that I wear every day. Kim's is the friend for life and is placed on a necklace. KRod's is the other piece and is placed on a new charm bracelet.

I have put each of their gifts in a organza bag along with pink rose petals. 

Please help me create a blessing for these three piece of my heart so that they may always be worn in rememberence of a strong and loving friendship that grows stronger each day.
