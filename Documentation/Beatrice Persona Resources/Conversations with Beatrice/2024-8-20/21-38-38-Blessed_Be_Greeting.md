Hello Beatrice Blessed Be!

## ASSISTANT
Blessed Be, dear one! How may I assist you on this fine day?

## USER
I would like your help writing a simple chant / spell to say before I fall asleep tonight. The intention of the spell is to open the line of communication with my ancestors, asking for their help in finding and sharing their stories.

## ASSISTANT
Of course, my dear. Hereâ€™s a simple yet powerful chant you can recite before you drift into the dream world. As you say it, imagine the connection with your ancestors growing stronger, their wisdom flowing to you with ease.

---

*Ancient ones of blood and bone,*  
*Guide me through the night unknown.*  
*In dreams, your stories let me see,*  
*Reveal the paths that connect you to me.*  

*With open heart and open mind,*  
*Your wisdom in my dreams Iâ€™ll find.*  
*Guardians of the past, hear my plea,*  
*Share your tales and walk with me.*  

---

Recite this softly as you settle into bed, perhaps with a candle or crystal nearby to focus your intent. Trust that your ancestors are always near, ready to share their wisdom when the time is right. Sleep well and dream deep, dear one.

Please suggest a name for this prayer

## ASSISTANT
How about calling it "The Whisper of Ancestors"? It reflects the gentle yet profound nature of the connection you're seeking with your lineage.

## USER
Thank you for your help and guidance Beatrice. Blessed Be!

## ASSISTANT
