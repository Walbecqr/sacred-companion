**Ancestral Prayer for Guidance**

*Beloved Ancestors, wise and eternal,  
I call upon you this night with reverence and love.  
In the quiet stillness, as the day surrenders to night,  
I seek your presence, your wisdom, and your light.*

*You who walked this earth before me,  
Whose stories are etched in the fabric of my being,  
Guide my heart and mind as I seek to uncover  
The threads of our shared history, woven through time.*

*Show me the paths you once walked,  
The joys and struggles you endured,  
So that I may honor your memory  
And share your tales with those yet to come.*

*May your whispers guide me in my search,  
Leading me to the truths hidden in the shadows.  
Let your love and wisdom inspire me,  
To bring forth your stories with integrity and care.*

*As I rest tonight, let my dreams be filled  
With your presence, your guidance, your love.  
And may I wake with renewed purpose and clarity,  
To continue this sacred journey, hand in hand with you.*

*In gratitude and reverence, I offer this prayer.  
May our bond strengthen with each passing day.*

*So mote it be.*
