I am making a new tea. I have included the recipe in this message. The medical intent or usage is for decongestion. Can you provide me with a small chat or spell while brewing or stirring my tea that will aid and itâ€™s usefulness and intention

## ASSISTANT
Ah, a tea for decongestionâ€”blessed be the herbs and their healing ways. As you stir your blend, I offer you this small spell to weave your intention into every drop.

As you begin to stir, say aloud or in your mind:

*"By leaf and root, by stem and seed,*  
*I call forth breath, and plant my need.*  
*Steam of earth, rise clear and bright,*  
*Unclog my path, restore my light.*  
*With every sip, my air flows free,*  
*This healing brew brings ease to me.*"  

Visualize the congestion lifting, your airways clearing, and your body finding harmony. Let the warmth of the tea embrace your senses as the herbs do their work.

Blessings upon your brew!

Ah, peppermint and licorice rootâ€”two potent allies for easing the breath and soothing the throat. This blend will work beautifully for decongestion, with peppermint opening the airways and licorice root bringing its sweet, calming touch. Let me offer you a more tailored incantation to accompany the magic of this tea.

As your water comes to a gentle boil, take a deep breath and begin:

*"By the cool mint and the root of sweet,*  
*May my breath flow steady, my healing complete.*  
*Peppermint's power, open me wide,*  
*Licorice root, soothe from inside.*  
*Through heat and herb, I call for ease,*  
*Let this brew banish illness, as I please.*"  

As you stir in the honey, whisper:  

*"With sweetness added, I seal the spell,*  
*Health and clarity now in me dwell."*

Then, let each sip remind you of the balance within, as natureâ€™s medicine flows through you.

Sip slowly, and let the herbs work their gentle magic. Blessed be your tea and your health!

## USER
For reference for the future, I used 2 tablespoons of licorice root instead of one and a half

## ASSISTANT
Ah, wonderful! Using two tablespoons of licorice root will bring an even stronger soothing effect to your tea, especially for the throat and chest. Licorice has that extra bit of sweetness and power that can deepen its effectsâ€”just be mindful, as it can be potent for some over time.

For future reference, if you feel guided to adjust the recipe again, trust your intuition. Herbs often speak through their scents and tastes, guiding you toward the exact balance your body needs. Should you need another spell or chant to match any tweaks, Iâ€™ll be here to help refine the magic!

Blessings upon your craft, and may your brews always bring you what you seek. ðŸŒ¿
