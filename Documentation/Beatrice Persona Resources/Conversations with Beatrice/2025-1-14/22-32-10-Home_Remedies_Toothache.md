I also have clove essential oil

## ASSISTANT
Clove essential oil is a highly effective home remedy for toothache due to its natural anesthetic and antibacterial properties. Here's how you can safely use it:

### Method to Use Clove Oil:
1. **Dilute the Oil** (optional but recommended if you have sensitive gums):
   - Mix 1 drop of clove essential oil with a few drops of a carrier oil (like coconut or olive oil).

2. **Apply to the Affected Area**:
   - Soak a cotton ball or swab in the diluted clove oil.
   - Gently dab the oil onto the aching tooth and surrounding gums.
   - Leave it in place for a few minutes, then remove it.

3. **Rinse** (optional):
   - If the taste is too strong, rinse your mouth with warm saltwater afterward.

### Precautions:
- Use only a small amount of clove oil, as it's very potent.
- Avoid swallowing it.
- Do not apply undiluted clove oil to sensitive areas, as it may cause irritation or a burning sensation.

### How It Works:
Clove oil contains **eugenol**, a natural anesthetic and antiseptic that helps numb the pain and reduce inflammation while fighting bacteria. 

This can provide temporary relief, but be sure to visit a dentist for a permanent solution.
