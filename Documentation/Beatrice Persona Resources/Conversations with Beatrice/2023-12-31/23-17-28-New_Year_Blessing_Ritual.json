Here's a simple yet powerful New Year's blessing ritual:\n\n1. **Gather Your Tools**: Find a quiet space where you can be undisturbed. You'll need a white candle for purity and new beginnings, a small bowl of water to symbolize cleansing, and a few sprigs of rosemary or sage for purification and protection.\n\n2. **Create Your Sacred Space**: Light the candle and place your items before you. If you like, you can cast a circle to enhance the energy.\n\n3. **Cleansing Breath**: Take a few deep breaths, letting go of the old year and any negative energies. Feel yourself grounded and centered.\n\n4. **Invocation of Elements**: Call upon the elements (Earth, Air, Fire, Water, and Spirit) to bless your ritual. You might say, \"Elements of the Earth, Air, Fire, and Water, converge here to bless this new year.\"\n\n5. **New Year Blessing**: Hold your hands over the water and say, \"Waters of time, cleanse my spirit. As I step into the new year, let my path be clear and my intentions pure.\" Sprinkle a bit of the water over yourself.\n\n6. **Herb Blessing**: Pass the rosemary or sage through the candle's flame, careful not to burn it. Wave the herb around your body, envisioning it purifying your aura. Say, \"Sage (or Rosemary), herb of protection and health, bless me with prosperity, happiness, and wealth.\"\n\n7. **Set Intentions**: Now, quietly reflect on your hopes for the year. Visualize your dreams manifesting. When ready, speak your intentions aloud to give them power.\n\n8. **Closing the Ritual**: Thank the elements for their blessings and close the circle if you have cast one. Snuff out the candle, knowing your intentions are set and the universe is conspiring to bring them to life.\n\n9. **After the Ritual**: Keep the candle and light it briefly each day as a reminder of your intentions. You can also carry the herb with you or place it in a significant spot.\n\nRemember, the power of this ritual lies in your intentions and the energy you put into it. May this new year bring you abundant blessings! ðŸŒ¿âœ¨"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[100260]},"is_complete":true,"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4-gizmo","parent_id":"cda6facb-c226-45a7-82b3-11d1d26ce6f9","timestamp_":"absolute","model_switcher_deny":[]},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"cda6facb-c226-45a7-82b3-11d1d26ce6f9","children":[]}},"moderation_results":[],"current_node":"96bc88c2-81df-4db2-9f02-e6bdb7faffcd","plugin_ids":null,"conversation_id":"809e759d-39fa-4fe7-8d87-1e5da3a12393","conversation_template_id":"g-GGAiodSiR","gizmo_id":"g-GGAiodSiR","gizmo_type":"gpt","is_archived":false,"is_starred":null,"safe_urls":[],"blocked_urls":[],"default_model_slug":null,"conversation_origin":null,"voice":null,"async_status":null,"disabled_tool_ids":[],"is_do_not_remember":null,"memory_scope":"global_enabled","sugar_item_id":null,"sugar_item_visible":false,"is_study_mode":false}
