The park has been a favorite to view the northern lights with the best times to view being between midnight and 3 am.\n\nBig Bay is distinctively known as being run on its own and being a protected area. The only way the island can be reached is by ferry, charter, or a private boat, which keeps the areas as natural and untouched as possible. All the better for viewing the big show. \n\nThe islands are all located on Lake Superior, and Madeline Island can be reached by ferry, private boat, or charter from nearby Bayfield, WI, found on the mainland.

It is derived from the maximum fluctuations of horizontal components observed on a magnetometer during a three-hour interval.“ source\n\nThe KP needs to be more than 5 to see anything in Wisconsin. \n\n## Ellison Bay Bluff County Park in Door County Wisconsin \n\nBay Bluff Park in Door County Wisconsin is said to be one of the best places to catch one of nature’s greatest shows. The location is perfect as it is ways away from any major metropolitan area that could pollute the skies. The area prides itself on being able to see the vivid stars and clear constellations, even the Milky Way. \n\n  * The best chance at seeing the northern lights require:\n  * Low light from the Moon\n  * K-index 5 or greater \n  * Clear Skies \n  * Low artificial light pollution \n  * Geomagnetic/Solar Storm\n\n## Big Bay State Park\n\nBig bay state park is on Madeline Island, which is the largest of the 22 Apostle Islands. The island is 2,350 acres that encompass landscapes from sandstone bluffs and caves to sand beaches. The park has been a favorite to view the northern lights with the best times to view being between midnight and 3 am.\n\nBig Bay is distinctively known as being run on its own and being a protected area. The only way the island can be reached is by ferry, charter, or a private boat, which keeps the areas as natural and untouched as possible. All the better for viewing the big show. \n\nThe islands are all located on Lake Superior, and Madeline Island can be reached by ferry, private boat, or charter from nearby Bayfield, WI, found on the mainland.

During summers in Wisconsin, the skies are dark enough to spot auroras. 【4†Show more】\n\n### Which areas in Wisconsin are most suitable for aurora hunting?\n\nThe most popular areas to hunt for auroras in Wisconsin are Door County, Ashland and Bayfield counties, and the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore. Lake Superior is another suitable location to observe northern lights in Midwest. Door County has low light pollution, especially as you travel further north. 【4†Show more】\n\n### Can aurora borealis be seen during the summer months in Wisconsin?\n\nAurora borealis have more chances of being seen during September through March. While summer skies are dark enough to spot auroras in Wisconsin, predicting geomagnetic activity and magnetic field strength is complex, making aurora sightings during summer unpredictable. 【4†Show more】\n\nAsk a question \n\n## Find hotels and airbnbs near Northern Lights (Map)\n\n  * 【15†Door County†www.google.com】\n  * 【16†Sturgeon Bay†www.google.com】\n  * 【17† Potawatomi State Park†www.google.com】\n  * 【18†Newport State Park†www.google.com】\n  * 【19†Washington Island †www.google.com】\n  * 【20†Bayfield and Ashland Counties†www.google.com】\n  * 【21†Nourse Sugarbush State Natural Area †www.google.com】\n  * 【22†Apostle Islands†www.google.com】\n\n## \n\nBest time \n\nSeptember–March \n\n  * May \n  * Jun \n  * Jul \n  * Aug \n  * Sep \n  * Oct \n  * Nov \n  * Dec \n  * Jan \n  * Feb \n  * Mar \n  * Apr \n  * May \n\nDo not miss it!

It also shows a 'viewline' that represents the southern-most locations from which you may see the aurora on the northern horizon.This product is based on the OVATION model and uses the maximum forecast geomagnetic activity (Kp) between 6pm and 6am US Central Time.\n\nThe two maps show the aurora and viewline tonight and tomorrow night. The brightness and location of the aurora is typically shown as a green oval centered on Earth’s magnetic pole.  The green ovals turn red when the aurora is forecasted to be more intense.  Aurora can often be observed somewhere on Earth from just after sunset or just before sunrise. The aurora is not visible during daylight hours.  The aurora does not need to be directly overhead but can be observed from as much as a 1000 km away when the aurora is bright and if conditions are right. \n\nA short term forecast (~30 minutes) along with the last 24 hours of activity can be found on the 【55†Aurora - 30 Minute Forecast】 page. And SWPC's new Aurora Dashboard (Experimental) collects the products and information from across SWPC's website for a one-stop shop.\n\n【6†Space Weather and GPS Systems】\n\n【5†Electric Power Transmission】\n\n【7†HF Radio Communications】\n\nThe OVATION (Oval Variation, Assessment, Tracking, Intensity, and Online Nowcasting) model  is an empirical model of the intensity of the aurora developed at the Johns Hopkins University, Applied Physics Laboratory by Patrick Newell and co-workers[1].  For tonight's and tomorrow night's aurora viewline prediction the SWPC 【40†3-Day Geomagnetic Forecast】 (Kp index) is used to drive the OVATION  model. The model uses maximum forecast geomagnetic activity (Kp) between 6pm and 6am US Central Time tonight and tomorrow night\n\nFor more information on the OVATION model and aurora products, see:\n\n  1.

While summer skies are dark enough to spot auroras in Wisconsin, predicting geomagnetic activity and magnetic field strength is complex, making aurora sightings during summer unpredictable. 【4†Show more】\n\nAsk a question \n\n## Find hotels and airbnbs near Northern Lights (Map)\n\n  * 【15†Door County†www.google.com】\n  * 【16†Sturgeon Bay†www.google.com】\n  * 【17† Potawatomi State Park†www.google.com】\n  * 【18†Newport State Park†www.google.com】\n  * 【19†Washington Island †www.google.com】\n  * 【20†Bayfield and Ashland Counties†www.google.com】\n  * 【21†Nourse Sugarbush State Natural Area †www.google.com】\n  * 【22†Apostle Islands†www.google.com】\n\n## \n\nBest time \n\nSeptember–March \n\n  * May \n  * Jun \n  * Jul \n  * Aug \n  * Sep \n  * Oct \n  * Nov \n  * Dec \n  * Jan \n  * Feb \n  * Mar \n  * Apr \n  * May \n\nDo not miss it!

It also shows a 'viewline' that represents the southern-most locations from which you may see the aurora on the northern horizon.This product is based on the OVATION model and uses the maximum forecast geomagnetic activity (Kp) between 6pm and 6am US Central Time.\n\nThe two maps show the aurora and viewline tonight and tomorrow night. The brightness and location of the aurora is typically shown as a green oval centered on Earth’s magnetic pole.  The green ovals turn red when the aurora is forecasted to be more intense.  Aurora can often be observed somewhere on Earth from just after sunset or just before sunrise. The aurora is not visible during daylight hours.  The aurora does not need to be directly overhead but can be observed from as much as a 1000 km away when the aurora is bright and if conditions are right. \n\nA short term forecast (~30 minutes) along with the last 24 hours of activity can be found on the 【55†Aurora - 30 Minute Forecast】 page. And SWPC's new Aurora Dashboard (Experimental) collects the products and information from across SWPC's website for a one-stop shop.\n\n【6†Space Weather and GPS Systems】\n\n【5†Electric Power Transmission】\n\n【7†HF Radio Communications】\n\nThe OVATION (Oval Variation, Assessment, Tracking, Intensity, and Online Nowcasting) model  is an empirical model of the intensity of the aurora developed at the Johns Hopkins University, Applied Physics Laboratory by Patrick Newell and co-workers[1].  For tonight's and tomorrow night's aurora viewline prediction the SWPC 【40†3-Day Geomagnetic Forecast】 (Kp index) is used to drive the OVATION  model. The model uses maximum forecast geomagnetic activity (Kp) between 6pm and 6am US Central Time tonight and tomorrow night\n\nFor more information on the OVATION model and aurora products, see:\n\n  1.

Checking a light pollution map might help you identify potential spots.
