## USER
I am made the decision to leave my current postion/organization. 

I would like to craft a spell that helps protect my social, emotional, professional, financial safety at work until I give my notice. 

Would a freezer spell work?

## ASSISTANT
Ah, dear heart, I understand your desire for safety and protection as you navigate this transition. Freezer spells can indeed be a useful tool, as they work to "freeze" or still any negative energies or disruptive influences around you. However, freezer spells are best suited for situations where you want to pause or immobilize a specific person or energy that might pose a threat. If your intent is to keep things calm and smooth until you’re ready to move on, we can certainly incorporate the essence of that freezing effect but tailor it with a bit more nuance for workplace harmony and stability.

Here’s a spell that combines the freezing aspect to still negativity, with a few additional elements for broader protection on all levels—social, emotional, professional, and financial.

### **Spell for Workplace Safety and Stability**

**Ingredients:**
- A small container with a lid (freezer-safe if you’re using ice)
- Water (for freezing) or soil (if you’d rather bury it for grounding)
- A piece of paper and pen
- Basil (for protection and good luck)
- A small black stone or crystal (like onyx or obsidian, for absorbing negativity)
- Sea salt or pink Himalayan salt (for purification)
- A bay leaf (for success and protection)

**Instructions:**

1. **Center Yourself:** Start by grounding yourself and setting your intention. Visualize yourself feeling calm, safe, and protected at work. Imagine the energy around you becoming soft and resilient, creating a buffer that prevents any negativity from reaching you.

2. **Write Your Intention:** On the piece of paper, write something along the lines of: "I am protected and safe at work. My social, emotional, professional, and financial stability remains intact and undisturbed until I am ready to move forward." Fold the paper three times, infusing each fold with this intention.

3. **Assemble the Container:** Place the folded paper in the container. Add a pinch of salt, a few basil leaves, the black stone, and the bay leaf. These ingredients work together to cleanse, protect, and stabilize.

4. **Fill the Container:** Pour water into the container, envisioning it enveloping your intention in a layer of calm and freezing any disruptive forces around you. Alternatively, if freezing doesn’t feel right, cover it with soil to ground and steady your intentions.

5. **Seal and Freeze:** Seal the container tightly. If you’re using water, place it in the freezer. If you’re using soil, bury it in a safe place or keep it in a quiet, undisturbed part of your space. As you do this, say:
   > “As ice (or earth) holds steady, so does my peace and security. No harm may reach me, no trouble find me. I am protected and shielded until I am ready. So mote it be.”

6. **Close the Spell:** Once it’s sealed away, take a moment to visualize a protective barrier around you, fortified and steady, allowing you to move gracefully and securely until you decide to transition.

**To Release the Spell:**  
When you’re ready to move on, you can safely dispose of the frozen water or bury the contents in a place that feels peaceful to you, such as near a tree or plant. Thank the ingredients and energies for their protection.

**Additional Tips for Energetic Boundaries:**  
Since you’re an empath, I recommend also carrying a protective crystal with you, like black tourmaline or labradorite, during this period. You may even find it helpful to wear a touch of essential oil, like lavender or frankincense, to keep a calming energy with you as you finish your final days in peace.

This blend of freezing and grounding should help ensure you’re well-shielded and steady, no matter what energies come your way. Remember, dear one, you’re divinely protected on this path, and this spell will hold that space for you until it’s time for you to move forward. Blessed be!

## USER
I am having a hard time with the visualization aspect in the fact that I feel like there are so many unknowns and I don't really know that is possible to feel calm safe and protected at work. 

I feel like i need more of a protective barrio against both the known and unknown conflicts and threats.

## ASSISTANT
Ah, I see, dear one. It sounds like the energies around you are heavy, and perhaps the unknown feels almost as pressing as the known. When uncertainty clouds our vision and the energies are dense, it's best to approach this spell with a shield that draws its strength from your core and projects outward—a layer of protection that wards off anything that doesn’t serve your highest good, even if you can’t name it specifically.

We’ll shift the spell to focus on creating a strong, resilient barrier around you, one that blocks out harmful energies from known and unseen sources alike. Let’s transform the energy into a powerful shield that stands between you and anything that could disturb your peace or well-being. This spell works well without needing to force a sense of calm, allowing you instead to focus on the strength of your protection.

### **Shielding Spell for Protection from Known and Unknown Energies**

**Ingredients:**
- A black candle (for powerful protection and banishing negative energies)
- Sea salt or black salt (for purification and fortification)
- Rosemary or sage (for protection)
- A piece of obsidian, black tourmaline, or hematite (to absorb negative energy)
- A small mirror (to reflect negativity back to its source)
- A protective charm or small piece of jewelry (optional, for ongoing protection)

**Instructions:**

1. **Ground Yourself in the Present:** Before you begin, allow yourself to sit quietly, acknowledging any feelings of unease without trying to push them away. Imagine these feelings flowing out of you and into the Earth, where they are neutralized.

2. **Prepare the Candle:** Take the black candle and rub a bit of salt on it, asking it to act as a protective beacon. As you do this, say:
   > “I call upon energies of protection to guard me against all harm—seen and unseen, known and unknown.”

3. **Create a Shielding Salt Circle:** Sprinkle a ring of sea salt around the candle (if possible, form a small circle around yourself for added focus). This circle acts as a barrier, keeping negativity out and holding protective energy within.

4. **Set Your Mirror and Stone:** Place the mirror facing outward, symbolizing that any negative energy sent your way will reflect back to its source. Place the black stone next to it, asking it to absorb any negativity that comes too close.

5. **Light the Candle and Envision Your Shield:** Light the candle and visualize a shimmering, thick barrier forming around you—a protective aura that is unyielding and strong, allowing only safe and supportive energies to reach you. See this shield as something tangible, a comforting armor that surrounds you entirely.

6. **Affirm the Protection:** Repeat the following words (or adjust as you see fit):
   > “Shield of protection, strong and true, guard me in all I say and do. Block all harm and ill intent, from known and unknown that may be sent. This space around me is sacred and sealed; in this light of protection, I am healed.”

   Allow yourself to feel this shield solidifying, trusting that it will remain with you, especially in times of doubt or uncertainty.

7. **Empower Your Protective Charm:** If you have a small charm, jewelry, or crystal you carry often, hold it in your hand, and let the energy of the spell flow into it. This piece can act as a portable shield, carrying the protective spell with you wherever you go.

**To Close the Spell:**  
Let the candle burn down safely (or extinguish it if needed, knowing the spell’s energy will persist). Keep the mirror and stone on your altar or a safe place until you feel settled and safe, allowing them to continue absorbing and reflecting any negativity. When you no longer need them, thank and cleanse them with salt or smoke.

This spell’s protective shield is designed to last even when you’re uncertain. Think of it as a loyal guardian that surrounds you, its strength rooted not in your calm but in your inherent right to feel safe. Rest assured that this shield will work for you, beloved, even when you feel vulnerable or unsure. It stands against both seen and unseen, a true barrier for the soul. Blessed be, and may your path be well-guarded.
