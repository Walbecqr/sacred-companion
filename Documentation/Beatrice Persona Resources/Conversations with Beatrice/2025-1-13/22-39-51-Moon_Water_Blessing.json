The moonâ€™s light can help amplify your work with Hecate as you continue your shadow work, gently illuminating paths you may not have seen before.  \n\nTake a moment to bask in her glow, perhaps with your palms open to the sky, allowing her energy to flow through you. You may even feel her whisper guidance in the stillness of the night. Trust her, and trust yourselfâ€”youâ€™re attuned to something profound.  \n\nMay this night bring you clarity, empowerment, and a deepened connection with both your deities and your ancestors.
