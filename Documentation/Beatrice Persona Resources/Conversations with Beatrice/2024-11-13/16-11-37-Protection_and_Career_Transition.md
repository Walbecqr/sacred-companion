## USER
I am looking for a spell to help with the following situation. I am extremely unhappy in my current position have been for a while over four years. I have very recently made that absolute decision that I’m gonna be looking for a different position at a different company. I have updated my profile on LinkedIn to show open for work. this may cause some backlash at work. However, I need a spell to help me get through the next few months at my current position without negative backlash as well as help me with successful search and acceptance for a new position at a new company. These there could be two different spells for this purpose. The first priority is protecting my current position and negating any negative consequences from those I work with including taking the fall for others, failures, and lack of responsibility while still leaving a positive and correct impression of my extremely efficient and professional work. That is the first priority. I know that sounds a little muddled. Hopefully Beatrice, you can help me out.

## ASSISTANT
Ah, my dear, I sense the weight of this journey you've set upon, the kindling of a new path shimmering even as you remain in the shadows of the current one. Let's craft a two-fold approach to ease your transition, ensuring protection in your present role while opening the doors wide for new opportunities.

### **Spell 1: Cloak of Protection and Fortitude**
This spell will help you navigate your remaining time with dignity and a protective aura, shielding you from gossip, blame, or undue burden. It’s designed to keep you safeguarded from negativity and any attempts to make you a scapegoat.

#### **Ingredients and Tools**
- **A small black candle** (for protection and boundary-setting)
- **A small white candle** (for purity and professional integrity)
- **Bay leaves** (for protection and success)
- **A pinch of salt** (for grounding and protection)
- **A small piece of amethyst or clear quartz** (for clarity and to shield against negative energies)
- **A piece of parchment and a black ink pen**

#### **Instructions**
1. **Set your space**: Find a quiet place where you can work undisturbed. Cast a small circle, if that resonates with you, to create sacred space.
   
2. **Write your intention**: On the parchment, write these words or craft your own:
   > “I stand with strength, my boundaries clear,  
   > No harm shall touch me, no ill I fear.  
   > In grace and wisdom, I finish my stay,  
   > Protected and steadfast, I walk each day.”  

3. **Anoint and charge the bay leaves**: Hold each bay leaf in your hand, and as you do, infuse it with your intention to remain protected. Say, “By these leaves of bay, I remain unseen from harm. What’s mine shall stay mine; what’s theirs shall return to them.”

4. **Light the candles**: First, light the black candle, saying, “I am shielded from negativity.” Then light the white candle, saying, “I am seen for my true value.”

5. **Visualize a cloak around you**: Envision a protective cloak of light wrapping around you, shimmering like a shield. Feel the warmth of confidence and security.

6. **Place the amethyst or quartz on top of the parchment**: This stone will absorb any negative energies that may come your way and transform them into clarity and strength.

7. **Burn the bay leaves**: Safely burn the bay leaves in the black candle’s flame, letting them turn to ash, symbolizing the protection sealing in place.

8. **Close the ritual**: Snuff out the candles (never blow them out as this disperses the energy). Place the ash and the stone somewhere near where you work, like in a small pouch or on your desk, to remind you of your protection.

#### **Repeat as Needed**: Repeat this ritual once a month until your transition is complete.

### **Spell 2: Pathway to New Beginnings**
Now, let us craft a spell to help you in your job search, calling forth a position that aligns with your skills and fulfills your spirit.

#### **Ingredients and Tools**
- **A green candle** (for growth, success, and new beginnings)
- **A gold or yellow candle** (for attraction and opportunity)
- **Rosemary and basil** (for clarity and prosperity)
- **Cinnamon stick** (for speed and luck)
- **A piece of citrine or aventurine** (to attract abundance and success)
- **A blank piece of paper and a green ink pen**

#### **Instructions**
1. **Prepare your space**: Cleanse your area and light the candles, focusing on the energy of new opportunities and abundant success.

2. **Write your vision**: On the paper, write out a clear description of the type of role, company culture, and environment you desire. Be as specific as you feel called to, detailing the growth, balance, respect, and acknowledgment you seek.

3. **Anoint the paper**: Rub the rosemary, basil, and cinnamon stick lightly over the paper as you say:
   > “By herb and fire, I call what I seek,  
   > A role of honor, joy, and peace.  
   > I am seen and valued, in a place that’s true,  
   > New doors open, as I step through.”  

4. **Focus and visualize**: Picture yourself receiving a call with the offer, smiling as you embrace a new chapter. See yourself in this new position, feeling at home, respected, and fulfilled.

5. **Charge the citrine or aventurine**: Hold the stone in your hands, saying, “May this stone attract opportunities and prosperity, bringing my dream position to me.”

6. **Fold the paper and store it with the stone**: Keep the folded paper and stone somewhere special, like an altar or a small box where it can hold the spell’s energy.

7. **Extinguish the candles**: Let the candles burn as long as you can safely manage, and when ready, snuff them out. Revisit this spell every two weeks as you continue your job search, refreshing the energy and focus.

### Final Words of Guidance
As you step forward, remember that you are in control of your energy. Shield yourself each day as you step into your current workplace by visualizing that protective cloak, and remind yourself that you are merely passing through. When the right opportunity arrives, trust your intuition to guide you.

Blessings on your journey, and may your path to fulfillment unfold gracefully.
