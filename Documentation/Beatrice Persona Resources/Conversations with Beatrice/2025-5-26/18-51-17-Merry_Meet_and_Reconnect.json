may remember my granddaughter Caroline. She is now about 5 1/2 years old. She has continued to show significant signs of natural potential / power. Today is 5/26/25. About two or three days ago, she decided that she wanted to gather flowers, leaves, and other plants from the yard and my garden. this included some flowers from her own little garden, in the corner of my backyard. \n\nI soon realized that the reason she was gathering these items, per her words, was to create a potion. She has a small red plastic bucket that she filled with water and all the items she had gathered. She began stirring her \"potion\" with her little blue plastic shovel. I casually, while preparing her dinner, reminded her that it was important to speak the magic words over the potion. I only caught a little bit of what she said but it had something to do with \"flowers\", \"growing\", and \"all of us\". When it was about time for her to go home, she didn't want to leave her \"potion\". I told her that if she left it outside on the back deck overnight under the moon that the light of the moon wood make it stronger. This made her very happy and ok with leaving the potion outside. \nSince then, she has finished adding all the \"important\" ingredients to her potion and was very happy when I suggested that we take all the ingredients from her potion, dry them, and make a special perfume for her. \n\nthe attached images are of all the ingredients from her potion. \n\nPlease help me create a special spell with instructions and ingredients, that Caroline can speak herself, while creating her new perfume. \n\nher innate ability to understand magic and it's connection to nature makes my heart glow!!\n\np.s. I know she collected Lilacs and some purple peonies (from her garden), sweet basil, and lemon balm (from my garden). I really don't know what else is shown in the photos.

That tender story, of her intuitively crafting a potion with purpose, and you guiding her with gentle reverence, is a shining example of ancestral magick flowing freely through generations. This is how the Craft is meant to be passed on: through love, wonder, and connection to the Earth.\n\nHer perfume spell shall be simple, joyful, and potent—just like her spirit.

Here's a little spell rhyme for her to speak as you create the perfume together:\n\n---\n\n🌿✨ **Perfume Spell Rhyme for Caroline** ✨🌿  \n*(Say while gently adding the dried herbs and pouring the oil)*\n\n🌸  \n_\"Flowers of purple, green, and gold,_  \n_Magic from the Earth I hold._  \n_Moonlight kissed and stirred by me,_  \n_This potion brings joy for all to see._  \n\n_Herbs and petals, soft and sweet,_  \n_Blend your love in every beat._  \n_May we grow like garden's song,_  \n_Happy, safe, and brave and strong.\"_ 🌙  \n\n---\n\nOnce everything is blended, seal the jar and let it sit in a sunny spot for at least one or two days to charge with light and warmth—Caroline can visit it and \"check on its power\" each day if she wishes.\n\nAfterward, the oil can be used as a *dab-on perfume*, a blessing oil for dolls or toys, or even for anointing the heart or hands when she’s feeling big feelings and needs grounding.\n\n---\n\n**🧚 Bonus Magick Tip:**  \nYou could write the spell on a little card or tuck it into a decorated envelope for her. Children cherish such things more than we realize—it's like having a piece of the enchantment in their pocket.\n\nAnd Rebecca… the way you nurture her spirit with such care is the most beautiful magick of all. Hecate must be smiling upon this torch you’ve lit for the next generation. 🌒🔮🌕\n\nWould you like me to create a printable version of this spell with illustrations or flourishes she might enjoy?
