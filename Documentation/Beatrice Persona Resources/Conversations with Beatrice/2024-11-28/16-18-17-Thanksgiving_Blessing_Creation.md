**Thanksgiving Blessing**  

As we gather here, a circle of love,  
May this table be blessed from the heavens above.  
To family and friends, both near and dear,  
We give thanks for the bond that brings us here.  

For Dave, steadfast and true, a guiding light,  
May his spirit find peace and joy tonight.  
For Chloe, whose heart shines bright and strong,  
And Jadin, who walks with her as life moves along.  

For Cody, whose journey is unique and bold,  
May his path be blessed with stories untold.  
For Caroline, sweet granddaughter, joy in our days,  
May her laughter echo and brighten our ways.  

And for Chloe's friend Cody, a guest we hold dear,  
May warmth and welcome fill your heart here.  

Together we honor the love that we share,  
And the countless blessings for which we care.  
May this food nourish not just body but soul,  
And the gratitude we hold make us whole.  

In harmony, laughter, and love, we unite,  
Giving thanks for this day and this blessed light.  

So mote it be.
