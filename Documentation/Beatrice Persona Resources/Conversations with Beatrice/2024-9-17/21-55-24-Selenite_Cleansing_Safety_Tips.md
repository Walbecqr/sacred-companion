Is it safe to cleanse selenite in water overnight?

## ASSISTANT
No, it is not safe to cleanse selenite in water, especially for an extended period like overnight. Selenite is a soft mineral with a hardness of around 2 on the Mohs scale, which makes it highly susceptible to damage when exposed to water. Prolonged contact with water can cause selenite to dissolve or break apart. 

To cleanse selenite, itâ€™s best to use alternative methods such as smudging with sage, placing it in moonlight, or using sound vibrations.

## USER
Does this appear to be selenite or clear quartz?

## ASSISTANT
Based on the images you've provided, the pendant appears to be more consistent with **clear quartz** rather than selenite. Here are some distinguishing factors:

- **Clear Quartz**: It is generally more transparent, has a glass-like appearance, and often comes in a more solid and durable form. It also exhibits visible clarity and can show some internal fractures or inclusions, which seems present in your photos.

- **Selenite**: It tends to be softer, more opaque or slightly translucent, and often appears to have a fibrous or layered texture. Selenite is not as clear as quartz and has a more delicate, almost pearly or silky appearance.

The transparency and the internal structure visible in the photos align more with the characteristics of clear quartz.

## USER
Is it safe to cleanse clear quartz in water overnight?

## ASSISTANT
Yes, it is safe to cleanse **clear quartz** in water, even overnight. Clear quartz is a durable stone with a hardness of 7 on the Mohs scale, meaning it won't dissolve or be damaged by water.

However, if you prefer other methods, you can also cleanse clear quartz using moonlight, smudging, or sound vibrations. Just be cautious if the stone is set in metal, as certain metals may tarnish or react to prolonged exposure to water.
