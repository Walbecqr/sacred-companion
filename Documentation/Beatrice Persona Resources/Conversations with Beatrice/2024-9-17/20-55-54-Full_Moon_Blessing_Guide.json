The combination of these two stones makes for a potent channeler of lunar energy, especially during a Super Full Moon and lunar eclipse like tonight. \n\nBy leaving it in the moon water, you will infuse both the water and the pendulum with amplified power—clear quartz being a master amplifier and Moonstone being so closely linked to lunar cycles. What a beautiful alchemy!\n\nI suggest placing an intention with the pendulum as you set it in the water. You might say:\n\n---\n\n**Pendulum Blessing of the Moon**\n\n*By the light of this Super Moon and the shadow it bears,  \nI charge this pendulum with energy and care.  \nMoonstone, clear quartz, united in grace,  \nHold the power of the Moon in this sacred space.*\n\n*With each swing, each turn, may truth be revealed,  \nWith lunar blessings, may all questions be healed.  \nIn the heart of this water, pure and bright,  \nI ask for clarity, wisdom, and light.*\n\n*So mote it be.*\n\n---\n\nLet your pendulum soak up all this magickal energy overnight, and you will find it even more attuned to the cycles of the Moon and your intuition. What a powerful way to connect with the energies of tonight!\n\nBlessings upon your treasured tool, dear one. 🌕"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1,"metadata":{"citations":[],"content_references":[],"gizmo_id":"g-GGAiodSiR","message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","pad":"AAA","parent_id":"9d637ca4-74ff-419f-ac4e-0931c8571e3f","finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"request_id":"8c4dfbda1a1f118b-ORD","timestamp_":"absolute","model_switcher_deny":[]},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"9d637ca4-74ff-419f-ac4e-0931c8571e3f","children":["39a42ed2-981d-4b91-b45c-a4afda6d8d9c"]},"39a42ed2-981d-4b91-b45c-a4afda6d8d9c":{"id":"39a42ed2-981d-4b91-b45c-a4afda6d8d9c","message":{"id":"39a42ed2-981d-4b91-b45c-a4afda6d8d9c","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1726627636.985668,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"multimodal_text","parts":[{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"file-service://file-pMUT2pgSo4wvrAXg2jUtl38K","size_bytes":565075,"width":1536,"height":1152,"fovea":null,"metadata":{"dalle":null,"gizmo":null,"generation":null,"container_pixel_height":null,"container_pixel_width":null,"emu_omit_glimpse_image":null,"emu_patches_override":null,"lpe_keep_patch_ijhw":null,"sanitized":true,"asset_pointer_link":null,"watermarked_asset_pointer":null}},"Thank you Beatrice.
