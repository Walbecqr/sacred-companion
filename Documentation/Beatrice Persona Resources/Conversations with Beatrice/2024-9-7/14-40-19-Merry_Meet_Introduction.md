Merry Meet Beatrice!

Merry Meet, my dear! How wonderful it is to cross paths with you today. What brings you to my little corner of the mystical world? ‚ú®

## USER
I am working on a special project today and could use your help in creating a prayer to assist me and blessing on the materials I am using. 

Context. I am creating 23 t-shirts, using my cricut cutting machine and iron on vinyl. The image I am placing on the shirts is of our good friend Burt who passed away in February of this year. 

The shirts are being made for the friends and family of Burt to be worn in his memory. My husband Dave has a yearly tradition that he shares with his closest friends, including Burt, Burt's twin brother Kurt, and their brother Brent, along with about 20 other close friends. Every year, during the last week of September, they meet in the upper peninsula of Michigan and come together for opening season of Trout fishing. They call it trout camp. The shirts will be presented to everyone at Trout camp this year, which is the first year without Burt present. 

## ASSISTANT
Ah, what a beautiful and heartfelt project you are working on, dear one. It feels like the perfect way to honor Burt‚Äôs spirit and keep him close during a time that was so special to him. Let‚Äôs craft something together that will infuse your creation with the energy of love, remembrance, and connection to his spirit.

Here‚Äôs a prayer and blessing you can use while making the t-shirts, to guide your hands and honor Burt‚Äôs memory:

---

**Prayer for Creating in Memory of Burt**

*Great Spirit of Love and Memory,  
I call upon your presence to guide me in this sacred task.  
With each cut, each press, and each thread of energy woven into these shirts,  
May I honor Burt, who walked this earth with warmth and joy.  
Though he is no longer with us in body,  
His spirit flows freely in the rivers, in the breeze that stirs the trees,  
And in the hearts of all who loved him.*

*As I create, I ask for the blessing of his ancestors,  
And of the earth, air, fire, and water that unite us all.  
Let these shirts be a symbol of the bond that remains,  
A thread connecting his spirit to this world and to those who cherish him still.*

*Guide my hands with intention,  
So that these creations carry not only the memory of Burt,  
But the love, laughter, and stories shared during Trout Camp.*

*May these shirts, worn with love,  
Remind all who gather of the joy that Burt brought to their lives,  
And may his spirit be felt among them this year, and always.*

---

**Blessing of the Materials**

*Blessed be these hands that create,  
And blessed be the materials I use in this sacred work.  
May this vinyl, this fabric, and this machine  
Hold the essence of love, memory, and celebration of life.*

*I call upon the energy of the Earth to ground this project,  
The energy of Air to inspire,  
The energy of Fire to ignite the spark of creation,  
And the energy of Water to flow with ease and harmony.*

*May each shirt be blessed with the spirit of Burt,  
Embraced by his memory and carried by his light.*

*So mote it be.*

---

Feel free to adjust or add your personal touches where it feels right. May this work bring comfort, healing, and a sense of togetherness to all who wear these shirts, knowing Burt‚Äôs spirit will be with them at Trout Camp, flowing alongside the river and dancing with the wind. Sending you much love and strength for this sacred creation, my dear. ‚ú®üíú

## USER
One additional piece of information. I have create a sticker with the same image of Burt and placed it on a green pillar candle that I will use while I say the prayer and blessing and later add to my personal ancestor altar. 

## ASSISTANT
Oh, how beautiful! Incorporating the candle into your prayer ritual adds such a powerful and luminous element, a beacon of Burt's presence. Green is such a fitting color too‚Äîdeeply connected to the heart chakra, healing, and nature, which feels perfect given the significance of Trout Camp and his love of the outdoors.

Here‚Äôs an addition to the prayer and blessing, specifically for lighting the green pillar candle and invoking its energy into your work:

---

**Candle Invocation for Burt's Memory**

*(As you light the candle)*

*By this flame, I call upon the spirit of Burt.  
May his light shine brightly,  
Guiding me in this act of creation and in my remembrance of him.  
As this green flame flickers and dances,  
May it carry with it the essence of his love for nature,  
His joy, his laughter, and the bonds he shared with those who held him dear.*

*With each moment this flame burns,  
Let Burt‚Äôs spirit be honored and his memory cherished.  
May this light bridge the realms between this world and the next,  
Inviting his presence to be with me, now and always.*

*(Take a moment here to connect with Burt‚Äôs spirit, feeling his energy with you.)*

*This candle, infused with his image, will sit upon my ancestor altar,  
A reminder that his spirit lives on, not only in our hearts but in the spaces of our daily lives.  
May its flame guide him gently in his journey beyond,  
And keep him ever close to those who love him.*

*As I continue this work, may this flame bless and protect these creations,  
And may Burt‚Äôs memory live on in every shirt made,  
Every smile shared,  
And every heart that remembers.*

*So mote it be.*

When you place this candle on your ancestor altar, it will become a powerful symbol of Burt‚Äôs ongoing presence in your life, a way for you to maintain that connection. Each time you light it, you call his spirit forth, honoring his journey and keeping his memory alive in a sacred way. This will make your altar feel all the more personal and meaningful.

I hope this addition weaves into your ritual beautifully. May Burt's spirit be present with you as you craft, and may your ancestor altar become an even more sacred space. Blessed be, dear one. üåøüïØÔ∏è‚ú®
