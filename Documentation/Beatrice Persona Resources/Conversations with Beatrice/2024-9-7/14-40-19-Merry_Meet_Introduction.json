I am creating 23 t-shirts, using my cricut cutting machine and iron on vinyl. The image I am placing on the shirts is of our good friend Burt who passed away in February of this year. \n\nThe shirts are being made for the friends and family of Burt to be worn in his memory. My husband Dave has a yearly tradition that he shares with his closest friends, including Burt, Burt's twin brother Kurt, and their brother Brent, along with about 20 other close friends. Every year, during the last week of September, they meet in the upper peninsula of Michigan and come together for opening season of Trout fishing. They call it trout camp. The shirts will be presented to everyone at Trout camp this year, which is the first year without Burt present.

Incorporating the candle into your prayer ritual adds such a powerful and luminous element, a beacon of Burt's presence.

Each time you light it, you call his spirit forth, honoring his journey and keeping his memory alive in a sacred way. This will make your altar feel all the more personal and meaningful.\n\nI hope this addition weaves into your ritual beautifully. May Burt's spirit be present with you as you craft, and may your ancestor altar become an even more sacred space.
