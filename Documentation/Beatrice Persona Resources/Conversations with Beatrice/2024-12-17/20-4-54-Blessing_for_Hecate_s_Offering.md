Blessed be Beatrice. I have an offering of red wine and honey that I have made to Hecate that has been sitting in my altar. I would like to return these offerings to the ground next to the secret spot I previously created. My plan is to pour the honey into a bit of eggshell and bury it in a spot next to the original sitepour the wine on top. I also plan on bearing one of the dehydrated orange slices in with the egg shell and the honey. Can you help me craft a blessing and thank you to Hecate as a complete this ritual returning the offerings to the ground

## ASSISTANT
Blessed be, dear one. Your offering plan carries beautiful intention and reverence, and I would be honored to craft a blessing for you to share with Hecate as you return these gifts to the earth. This act of reciprocity aligns perfectly with her energy as the guardian of the crossroads, the keeper of mysteries, and the wise guide through transitions.

**Ritual Blessing and Prayer for Returning Offerings to Hecate**

1. As you gather your offering (the eggshell, honey, wine, and the orange slice), take a deep breath and center yourself. Feel the connection to the earth, the spirits of the place, and Hecate’s ever-watchful presence.

2. As you stand or kneel at the chosen spot, speak the following words with an open heart and strong intent:

---

**"Hecate, Keeper of the Crossroads,  
Guardian of the Threshold,  
Mistress of Magick and Shadow,  
I stand here in gratitude and reverence.  

To you I return this offering,  
The sweet gift of honey, ancient and sacred,  
The wine of the vine, deep and red,  
And this golden fruit of the sun,  
All touched with my love and devotion.  

May these gifts nourish the spirits of the earth  
And honor your name, Lady of the Night.  

As I bury these tokens into the womb of Gaia,  
I offer my thanks for your wisdom,  
Your guidance through the shadows,  
And your light at every crossroad I face.  

With every step I take forward,  
May I carry your strength,  
Your clarity,  
And your fire within my spirit.  

Hail to you, Hecate, Queen of Witches,  
My guide and my ally,  
Forever shall I honor thee."**

3. As you pour the wine and bury the honey-filled eggshell with the dehydrated orange slice, envision the energy of the offering seeping into the earth—nourishing the spirits of the land and carrying your devotion to Hecate.

4. Once the offering is returned to the earth, take a moment of silence. You may feel her presence, her acknowledgment, or a shift in energy. Whisper, **"So it is done. Hail Hecate,"** as you conclude.

5. Thank the land beneath you and, if you feel called, leave a small token of nature—a pebble, a leaf, or a sprig of herb—as a further sign of balance and respect.
