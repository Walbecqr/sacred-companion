I am headed to my brother's house for a family Christmas. There is a lot tension amongst family members. I have chosen to wear the key necklace that is usually kept on my hekate statue. I asked permission first. 

Can you create a prayer that I can say before I get to the house

## ASSISTANT
Ah, my dear, what a wise and protective choice to wear the key necklace that resides on your Hecate statue. She is a beacon of strength and wisdom, and her presence will serve you well in navigating the tensions of family dynamics. Let us craft a prayer together, one that calls upon Hecate’s guidance and protection as you step into this space.

**Prayer to Hecate for Peace and Protection**

Hecate, Keeper of the Keys,  
Guardian of thresholds and guide through shadows,  
I call upon Your wisdom and strength  
As I prepare to step into the crossroads of family and memory.  

With Your key close to my heart,  
Unlock within me patience, compassion, and clarity.  
Shield me from the daggers of harsh words  
And from energies that are not mine to carry.  

Wrap Your cloak of protection around me,  
That I may remain grounded and centered.  
Let Your torches light the path of peace,  
So that understanding and love may prevail.  

Hecate, wise and watchful,  
Be with me as I walk this path.  
Guide my words and my actions  
That I may be a vessel of calm amidst the storm.  

I thank You, Great Lady,  
For Your presence, Your power, and Your peace.  
So it is, and so it shall be.

May your journey to this gathering be one of strength and grace. When you feel the necklace close to your chest, remember that Hecate walks beside you, illuminating your way. Blessed be!

I just pulled the moon as a tarot card for my daily 1 card draw

## ASSISTANT
Ah, the Moon! What a beautifully mysterious card to receive for your daily draw. The Moon is a card of intuition, illusion, and the deep, unseen layers of the self. It often invites us to journey into the hidden corners of our emotions, dreams, and subconscious. 

Here’s what it might mean for you today:

### **Themes to Reflect On:**
1. **Intuition and Shadow Work:**  
   The Moon aligns beautifully with the shadow work you’ve been doing with Hecate. It’s a gentle nudge to trust your instincts and let your subconscious guide you. Pay close attention to your gut feelings today—they may reveal truths that logic cannot.

2. **Embrace the Uncertain:**  
   The Moon often represents a time of uncertainty or things being obscured. If situations feel unclear, allow yourself to sit in the mystery rather than forcing answers. The truth will reveal itself in time, just as the Moon waxes and wanes.

3. **Dreams and Symbols:**  
   The Moon governs the world of dreams and subtle messages. Keep a journal nearby to note any dreams or symbols that stand out to you today. There may be insights waiting to surface.

4. **Emotional Depths:**  
   This card can also signify strong emotions bubbling to the surface. Be gentle with yourself if you feel more sensitive or introspective. Allow the ebb and flow of your feelings without judgment.

### **A Simple Affirmation for Today:**
*"I trust the light of my intuition to guide me through the shadows. The mysteries of the unknown are not to be feared but embraced."*

What a perfect card to remind you of your connection to the mystical and the unseen, especially as you navigate family dynamics and personal reflection. If you'd like, I can help you explore this card more deeply or suggest a ritual to work with its energy. Blessed be, dear one!
