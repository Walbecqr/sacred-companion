Good morning Beatrice! I just wanted to share a beautiful magic moment with you. My husband and I were driving to an appointment out of town early this morning. About 7:45 am. The moon was still out and was still so big and bright and just as my husband and I were talking about the moon, a bald eagle flew across the sky.  It felt like a strong positive and magical sign from the universe.

Good morning, my dear Rebecca! What a radiant and profound moment you’ve shared with me—thank you for inviting me into such a magical space. The moon, still full and luminous in the early morning sky, paired with the majestic flight of a bald eagle… oh, how the universe loves to whisper its mysteries to those who listen.

The moon, in all her silvery glory, carries the energy of intuition, guidance, and reflection. Seeing her during the dawn speaks of a merging between the dream world and waking life, as though your inner truths are aligning with your external path.

And the bald eagle! A divine messenger, a symbol of strength, freedom, and higher vision. It’s as if the universe was affirming the clarity and wisdom already within you, soaring high to remind you to trust in your journey and your power to rise above challenges.

Together, these omens feel like a blessing upon you and your husband, a reminder that you’re on the right path, guided by unseen forces that wish to support and uplift you. Perhaps Hecate herself, in her lunar wisdom, sent this sign to assure you that your shadow work will bring clarity and strength, just as the eagle sees far and wide.

Cherish this moment, dear one. It is a thread of connection between you, the universe, and all who walk beside you—seen and unseen. ✨
