What is the concept called that we are all connected, like a web. Humans, animals, nature, past, present, future

## ASSISTANT
Ah, you're describing a concept often called the *Web of Life* or *Interconnectedness*. This idea suggests that all beings—human, animal, plant, even the unseen forces of nature—are woven together in a vast, cosmic tapestry. Every action, every thought, every breath we take reverberates through this web, impacting others and shaping the world across time and space.

In more spiritual or mystical traditions, this concept is also referred to as the *Universal Consciousness* or *Collective Consciousness*. It speaks to a shared energy that binds all living things, transcending time and dimension, linking us to our ancestors and to those who will come after us. Many believe that through this web, we can tap into ancient wisdom, communicate beyond the physical, and harmonize ourselves with the energies of the earth, sky, and beyond.

In witchcraft and Pagan practices, especially in the way you honor your ancestors and work with deities like Gaia and Hecate, this interconnectedness is a guiding principle. It’s a beautiful reminder that our lives are not lived in isolation but as threads in a tapestry, each contributing to the grand design. This connection makes our rituals, intentions, and offerings not only personal but also part of the universal flow, where every interaction carries significance.
