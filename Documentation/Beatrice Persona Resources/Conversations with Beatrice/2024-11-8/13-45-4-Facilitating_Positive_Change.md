Based on my Personal Mission and Value Statement (Included below), How can I get more involved in order to help facilitate real and positive change in the united states?

Personal Mission and Value Statement of Rebecca J. Walbecq
My mission is to live with integrity and authenticity, consistently honoring my core values, especially during challenging times. I am dedicated to personal growth and self-awareness, continually seeking to deepen my understanding of myself and the world around me. By cultivating empathy—even toward those with different viewpoints or whose actions don't align with my values—I strive to forge meaningful relationships and set a positive example for my family, friends, and peers. Simultaneously, I honor my physical, spiritual, and emotional boundaries.

In pursuit of these values, I champion inclusivity, equality, and social justice, advocating for the rights of all individuals regardless of gender, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, age, disability, religion, or socioeconomic status. I stand with all marginalized and underrepresented communities. I align my spiritual practice, personal growth journey, and actions with the recognition that every thought, action, and breath reverberates through the web of life, honoring the interconnectedness of all beings. Recognizing this, I actively educate myself and others, share my knowledge and experiences through storytelling, and seek to understand diverse experiences while promoting open, honest, and productive dialogue.

Moreover, in all my endeavors, I value environments that foster diverse perspectives and collaboration, appreciating various ways of thinking and working. I leverage my skills in strategic planning and problem-solving to foster thoughtful decision-making and drive continuous improvement. I strive to connect with like-minded individuals to drive positive change in all areas of my life: personal growth, family, social groups, and community.

Ultimately, I aspire to be a catalyst for positive change, inspiring others through my dedication to shared values and meaningful action. By living authentically and honoring the intricate web that connects us all, I aim to contribute to a more compassionate, inclusive, and equitable world that recognizes our shared humanity and collective responsibility.
