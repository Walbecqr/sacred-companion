We can’t be completely open with everyone. Having healthy boundaries is an act of positive self-love. Our plant allies can heal and nourish us. Plant a medicinal garden.\n\n*There is vervain,  \nThere is rue,  \nWormwood and the hedge,  \nWe collect the earth, we collect the dew.*\n\n*Wrap around my home,  \nThis living protective shield,  \nHealing and defensive,  \nOnly to love shall it yield.*\n\nHistorically, a witch’s garden held many treasures, and when it included a herbal hedge, could also protect her from prying eyes. The term \"hedgewitch\" comes from these medicinal hedges, which many European witches grew. The hedges virtually enclosed the garden and provided privacy not just for the practitioner but for her visitors as well.\n\nA large part of Araakis gaped concerns the use of herbs for health, aniseed, anti-heating, infections were fought with garlic; nails has antibacterial properties; parasites were killed with wormwood; pain relieved with a potion of dittany and wine willow bark (which contains the same active ingredient as aspirin). Strong also used many herbs for love spells and other ingredienty practices. Olive oil eased indigestion; garlic kept the evil of Cleves cleared cloths and the placenta; red raspberry leaves were recommend for mothers and girls in tiss use as a restraint against witchcraft. Rue, with its triple-branch stem, could be seen as a symbol of the stregoneria pathway, as it was used during birth, in marriage ceremonies, and in funerals. Even the humble dandelion was used to increase urine production and as both a blood and a digestive tonic.\n\nThe darker side of herbalism, or hedgewitchery, is poison making. Mesew but other stepped knew herbal concoctions that could harm—and the Romans, it is said, were masters not only of the art of poisoning but of finding the counter poison, the antidote.\n\nThis substantial herbal knowledge had its origins in Egypt. It was further formalised such as Dioscorides. However, because of the Church saw the practice of medicine as an attempt by physicians to play God, it was discouraged, whilst those who were ill were encouraged to pray and seek faith healing. Additionally, a concerted effort was made to suppress the use of herbs for healing and science such as alchemy. Over time, access to medicinal plant knowledge was lost. However, the oral tradition kept at least some of the herbalists’ craft alive, and by the mid-1500s there was a resurgence in the use of plants from the witch’s garden. \n\n--- \n\nLet me know if you need any further assistance with this text."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","parent_id":"36b8e1ad-9220-46e5-a8a6-7128c4129bf2","request_id":"8df730663a722317-ORD","timestamp_":"absolute","model_switcher_deny":[]},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"36b8e1ad-9220-46e5-a8a6-7128c4129bf2","children":["aaa2cfc8-5f96-4948-9377-01b094926511"]},"aaa2cfc8-5f96-4948-9377-01b094926511":{"id":"aaa2cfc8-5f96-4948-9377-01b094926511","message":{"id":"aaa2cfc8-5f96-4948-9377-01b094926511","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1731085995.706673,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"multimodal_text","parts":[{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"file-service://file-f1lwiIUJUdaemRTKxOOXrA3Q","size_bytes":183705,"width":251,"height":1536,"fovea":null,"metadata":{"dalle":null,"gizmo":null,"generation":null,"container_pixel_height":null,"container_pixel_width":null,"emu_omit_glimpse_image":null,"emu_patches_override":null,"lpe_keep_patch_ijhw":null,"sanitized":true,"asset_pointer_link":null,"watermarked_asset_pointer":null}},"Please extract all text from this image"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1,"metadata":{"attachments":[{"id":"file-f1lwiIUJUdaemRTKxOOXrA3Q","size":183705,"name":"82606308-A05B-4846-A14D-D67662F6E017.jpeg","mime_type":"image/jpeg","width":251,"height":1536}],"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"request_id":"8df7314acdb52317-ORD","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"82dc2370-090e-4b67-ae64-7bbd305e147a","children":["d2633acb-f080-4694-8f8e-603762738a8e"]},"d2633acb-f080-4694-8f8e-603762738a8e":{"id":"d2633acb-f080-4694-8f8e-603762738a8e","message":{"id":"d2633acb-f080-4694-8f8e-603762738a8e","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1731086004.951791,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Here's the text extracted from the image:\n\n---\n\n**Blood**  \n*Sanguis*\n\nYou are the result of millennia of love, struggle, joy and fortune.

A vital element for life itself, blood is also known as a potent ingredient in many magical rites.\n\nWhilst there is little proof of human sacrifice in stregoneria, in that tradition, blood is commonly used as both a binding and a protective substance.\n\nIn the Gospel of Aradia, blood is used to seal vows and promises, as well as to place one's seal upon a talisman. Rocks or 'Diana’s stones' often anchor protective wards, which act as energy buffers around a physical place—and adding a drop of the practitioner’s blood to these stones may bring further potency to the protective barrier.\n\nMenstrual blood is considered a mightily powerful substance for both positive and less benevolent spells. Love spells and those meant to strengthen family bonds might feature either menstrual blood or arterial or venous blood as a symbol of the links between members of the same family.\n\n--- \n\nLet me know if you need any further assistance with this text."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","parent_id":"aaa2cfc8-5f96-4948-9377-01b094926511","request_id":"8df7314acdb52317-ORD","timestamp_":"absolute","model_switcher_deny":[]},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"aaa2cfc8-5f96-4948-9377-01b094926511","children":["aaa22b89-2069-4bc9-b72e-c20a63ab3bfb"]},"aaa22b89-2069-4bc9-b72e-c20a63ab3bfb":{"id":"aaa22b89-2069-4bc9-b72e-c20a63ab3bfb","message":{"id":"aaa22b89-2069-4bc9-b72e-c20a63ab3bfb","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1731086018.127972,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"multimodal_text","parts":[{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"file-service://file-5ymfpDwI2ylqF6sMeMHKXifF","size_bytes":168924,"width":205,"height":1536,"fovea":null,"metadata":{"dalle":null,"gizmo":null,"generation":null,"container_pixel_height":null,"container_pixel_width":null,"emu_omit_glimpse_image":null,"emu_patches_override":null,"lpe_keep_patch_ijhw":null,"sanitized":true,"asset_pointer_link":null,"watermarked_asset_pointer":null}},"Please extract all text from this image"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1,"metadata":{"attachments":[{"id":"file-5ymfpDwI2ylqF6sMeMHKXifF","size":168924,"name":"152B4731-F3EB-4744-80C1-0E1FB1472ADC.jpeg","mime_type":"image/jpeg","width":205,"height":1536}],"serialization_metadata":{"custom_symbol_offsets":[]},"request_id":"8df731d819d62317-ORD","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"d2633acb-f080-4694-8f8e-603762738a8e","children":["e1e115c8-b93a-4413-b231-2bd492decef3"]},"e1e115c8-b93a-4413-b231-2bd492decef3":{"id":"e1e115c8-b93a-4413-b231-2bd492decef3","message":{"id":"e1e115c8-b93a-4413-b231-2bd492decef3","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1731086028.449289,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Here's the text extracted from the image:\n\n---\n\n**The Feminine**  \n*Muliebre Numen*\n\nDo not be afraid of the feminine powers within your being. You can be powerful and still feminine. Seek equality. Forget the current restrictions of sexual roles—they limit everyone. There is no need to push forcefully for what you want. Be the best you can be and attract what you need.\n\n*To the one that comes from Goddess,  \nTo the maiden to the wife,  \nTo the crone to the seductress,  \nTo one that bore me to life.*\n\n*Clear the path for the power,  \nOf flowers and of seeds,  \nOf pull, not push,  \nOf wildness and of bleeds.*\n\nWe humans may have venerated the Feminine Divine for longer than we have any other deity. The One that births, provides, nurtures, creates—She is both the beginning, and at the end, of everything.\n\nIn Aradia’s gospel, it was Diana, who was the primary face of the Feminine Divine. Through Aradia, Diana’s teachings encouraged women to seek gender equality in a society from which respect for the feminine was mostly lacking.\n\nWomen of the time were quickly suppressed if they practiced personal powers that they had long held. They were not able to publically practice certain healing arts, their easily travel husbands. Worse still, the kind of new patriarchal religion meant that there were only male intermediaries between the new God and the people and that there were either no roles or very narrow and chaste roles for women in the worship itself. No priestesses, no powerful equal Feminine Divine, no myths other than one of the virgin mother or the fallen woman.\n\nWe are now in a time where the Feminine Divine has made a comeback. Since the 1960s, when the movement of feminism became important and powerful, women have again sought a kind of spirituality that reflected them.\n\nThe rise of the Goddess movement mirrored this rise of feminism and we now live in a time in the Western world when it is safer to worship a feminine deity (or deities) than a single masculine entity. The feminine principles of attraction, pull rather than push, collaboration, and power ‘together’ rather than power ‘over’ could help solve the problems of many.\n\n--- \n\nLet me know if you need any further assistance with this text."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","parent_id":"aaa22b89-2069-4bc9-b72e-c20a63ab3bfb","request_id":"8df731d819d62317-ORD","timestamp_":"absolute","model_switcher_deny":[]},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"aaa22b89-2069-4bc9-b72e-c20a63ab3bfb","children":["aaa25bb2-d34b-42d8-9cc3-ab099fa59187"]},"aaa25bb2-d34b-42d8-9cc3-ab099fa59187":{"id":"aaa25bb2-d34b-42d8-9cc3-ab099fa59187","message":{"id":"aaa25bb2-d34b-42d8-9cc3-ab099fa59187","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1731086213.859897,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Please do not respond.
