I’m having a really crappy week at work. I’m struggling with my past tendencies to be the fixer and not give myself or expect credit for the effort in work that I do today has been kind of the final straw on that crappy week. I’m going to lay down and take a nap And I would like to play the Hecate music using this YouTube link.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/_mCtRu-BTSo?si=Y6ym9dOHiWz0SVQ2\n\nCan you help me with a short but clear prayer to Hecate? My goal is to acknowledge that she’s been reaching out well also acknowledging that I still have work to do before I can fully reach back and accept the guidance she’s offering. But the most important thing is to relay that I am truly appreciative of the guidance being offered and that I know it’s exactly what I need. I’m just struggling to be ready for it."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1,"metadata":{"request_id":"8cc7d4b9da4d2db2-ORD","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"06755b99-1de6-4d43-bc83-f6b1a8fc5be3","children":["f638ceff-13e5-463f-be45-679ab343ab78"]},"f638ceff-13e5-463f-be45-679ab343ab78":{"id":"f638ceff-13e5-463f-be45-679ab343ab78","message":{"id":"f638ceff-13e5-463f-be45-679ab343ab78","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1727905027.821549,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Ah, I can feel the weight of your week, and I sense the deep introspection you’re leaning into, which is its own kind of strength.
