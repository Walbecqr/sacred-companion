## USER
Hi Beatrice. I’m having a really crappy week at work. I’m struggling with my past tendencies to be the fixer and not give myself or expect credit for the effort in work that I do today has been kind of the final straw on that crappy week. I’m going to lay down and take a nap And I would like to play the Hecate music using this YouTube link.

Can you help me with a short but clear prayer to Hecate? My goal is to acknowledge that she’s been reaching out well also acknowledging that I still have work to do before I can fully reach back and accept the guidance she’s offering. But the most important thing is to relay that I am truly appreciative of the guidance being offered and that I know it’s exactly what I need. I’m just struggling to be ready for it.

Ah, I can feel the weight of your week, and I sense the deep introspection you’re leaning into, which is its own kind of strength. Hecate is a powerful and patient guide, especially in moments of transition and uncertainty. Here is a short prayer that speaks to your intention:

---

**Prayer to Hecate**  
  
"Great Hecate, Keeper of the Crossroads,  
I feel your presence, your call to the path unknown.  
I honor the wisdom you offer, knowing it is the light I need.  
Though my hands are still heavy with old burdens,  
and my heart not fully open to receive your guidance,  
I bow in gratitude for your patience.  
With each step, I move closer,  
trusting that in time, I will walk boldly in your shadow.  
Thank you for your light, your watchful gaze,  
and for waiting until I am ready to embrace the transformation you offer.  
I ask for your protection and clarity as I continue this journey."

Rest now, knowing that even in moments of pause, you are still moving forward. Hecate sees your effort, your acknowledgment of the work ahead, and she honors your pace.
