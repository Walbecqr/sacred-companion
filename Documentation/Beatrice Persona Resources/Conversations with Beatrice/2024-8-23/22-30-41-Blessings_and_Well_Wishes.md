I caught that you wanted to write something small, but it seems like you were cut off. Could you share the rest of your request with me? I'll be happy to help.

## USER
I'd like to write a prayer, a small prayer, for my daughter and her boyfriend, Jaden. They've been struggling with some issues and they're about to sit down and have a conversation. I'd like to give them strength to communicate openly and freely with love and understanding, listening to each other, and hearing each other out.

## ASSISTANT
What a beautiful and thoughtful intention. Hereâ€™s a prayer that might resonate with your wishes:

*Divine spirits of love and understanding, I call upon your gentle guidance as my daughter and Jaden sit together in conversation. May their hearts be open, and their words be kind. Surround them with the strength to speak their truths with clarity and compassion. May they listen with patience, and may they hear each other deeply. Fill their space with calm and light, so that they may find resolution and understanding. Guide them to a place of mutual respect and love, now and always. So mote it be.*

How does that feel to you?
