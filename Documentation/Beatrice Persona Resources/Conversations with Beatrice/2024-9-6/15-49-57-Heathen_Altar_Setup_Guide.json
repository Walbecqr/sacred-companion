Altars in Heathenry are known as **hörgr** (a stone altar) or **stallr** (a wooden altar or platform). Here's a step-by-step guide to help you create one:\n\n### 1. **Choose a Location**\n   - Find a space in your home or outdoors that feels sacred to you. It should be a place where you can focus and feel a connection to the gods and spirits.\n   - Indoors, this could be a quiet corner or shelf. Outdoors, a natural spot like under a tree or by a stream works well, as it connects with land spirits.\n\n### 2. **Altar Surface**\n   - Decide whether you want a wooden or stone base. Historically, **hörgr** refers to a stone structure, while a **stallr** is typically wooden. Choose one that suits your space.\n   - Clean the area and clear any distractions to set it apart as sacred.\n\n### 3. **Symbols of the Gods and Spirits**\n   - **Statues or Images**: Many Heathens place representations of their patron deities or those they feel particularly connected to. Thor's hammer (Mjölnir) is a common symbol, as is Odin’s spear (Gungnir) or ravens (Huginn and Muninn).\n   - **Runes**: You can carve or place rune stones that have significance for you, your deities, or any working you plan to do.\n   - **Personal or Natural Items**: Seashells, stones, feathers, or branches can serve as symbols of the landvættir.\n\n### 4. **Offerings**\n   - Traditionally, altars are a place for offerings. You might include:\n     - **Bowl or Horn for Blót**: A bowl or drinking horn is often used for offerings of mead, beer, or water. This can be central to your altar.\n     - **Food Offerings**: Fruits, bread, or other symbolic foods are left as gifts to the gods, ancestors, or spirits.\n     - **Candles or Oil Lamps**: Lighting candles in honor of the gods or spirits helps create a sacred atmosphere. Use colors or materials that are meaningful for the deity or ritual.\n     - **Incense or Herbs**: Burn herbs like juniper, mugwort, or sage to create a connection with the spiritual realm. Historically, sacred fires were also used.\n\n### 5. **Ancestor Representation**\n   - Include photos, mementos, or symbolic items for your ancestors. Heathenry places a strong emphasis on veneration of family and lineage.\n   - A small section of the altar can be dedicated to them, or you can incorporate them into your general offerings.\n\n### 6. **Tools for Ritual**\n   - **Hammer**: Thor’s hammer (Mjölnir) is often placed on the altar to hallow the space or during rituals to ask for Thor's protection.\n   - **Drinking Horn**: Used during blót, a horn can be filled with mead, beer, or another beverage to offer to the gods.\n   - **Ritual Knife (Seax)**: Used for carving runes or symbols on objects or candles, or for preparing offerings.\n\n### 7. **Personal Touch**\n   - Make your altar yours. While it's rooted in tradition, Heathenry allows personal expression. You might add things that resonate with your experiences, like special stones you've found or crafts you've made.\n\n### 8. **Regular Maintenance and Offerings**\n   - Keep your altar clean and tended to. Heathens often leave offerings as part of a daily or weekly practice, or during key festivals like Yule, Midsummer, or Blót.\n\n### Example Altar Setup:\n- **Centerpiece**: A carved wooden figure of Thor or Freyja.\n- **Offerings**: A drinking horn, small bowl for offerings, a loaf of bread.\n- **Natural Elements**: Feathers, stones, branches, or bones representing local land spirits.\n- **Ancestor Area**: A small photo or heirloom connected to family.\n- **Lighting**: A candle in a wrought-iron holder.\n  \nYour Heathen altar is a reflection of your path and your relationships with the gods, ancestors, and landvættir. There is no rigid formula, and it will evolve as your practice deepens."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1,"metadata":{"citations":[],"content_references":[],"gizmo_id":"g-d8Ap3gFBz","finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","pad":"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA","parent_id":"aaa25d35-1d44-4f20-a2f7-5cb3dacd51f1","request_id":"8bf1541a4f6d22f8-ORD","timestamp_":"absolute","model_switcher_deny":[]},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"aaa25d35-1d44-4f20-a2f7-5cb3dacd51f1","children":[]}},"moderation_results":[],"current_node":"316eca9d-f09d-4c41-8057-cd705a4d3854","plugin_ids":null,"conversation_id":"66db6af4-d114-8001-a778-88e3982ec751","conversation_template_id":"g-p-67bc0bd3738c81919257087d309f13c6","gizmo_id":"g-p-67bc0bd3738c81919257087d309f13c6","gizmo_type":"snorlax","is_archived":false,"is_starred":null,"safe_urls":[],"blocked_urls":[],"default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","conversation_origin":null,"voice":null,"async_status":2,"disabled_tool_ids":[],"is_do_not_remember":null,"memory_scope":"global_enabled","sugar_item_id":null,"sugar_item_visible":false,"is_study_mode":false}
