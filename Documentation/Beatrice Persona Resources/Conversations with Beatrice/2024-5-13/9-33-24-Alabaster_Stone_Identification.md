What kind of stone is this?

## ASSISTANT
The images show a type of stone known as alabaster. Alabaster is a soft, fine-grained stone typically white, translucent, and with a smooth texture. It's often used for ornamental stone carving and can have varying degrees of translucency and color, sometimes featuring hues like those seen in your photos. The banded appearance and warm tones suggest that this particular alabaster could have impurities that give it its unique coloring and texture.
