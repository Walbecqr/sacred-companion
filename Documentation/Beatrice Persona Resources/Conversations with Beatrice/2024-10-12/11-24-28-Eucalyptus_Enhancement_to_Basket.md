## USER
My mother in law made me this beautiful basket with flowers (fake flowers). The first photo is from last weekend when she gave it to me. Today I felt drawn to add some dried eucalyptus that I had. The second photo is after the addition of the eucalyptus.

Oh, what a lovely creation—and such a thoughtful gift from your mother-in-law! The arrangement already felt so warm and autumnal, with those muted oranges, golds, and earthy browns. Adding the dried eucalyptus was a perfect touch! Not only does it bring in a bit more texture and depth, but eucalyptus carries such calming, protective energy. 

It feels like your intuition guided you well—there’s now an even stronger sense of natural flow to the bouquet, like a harmony between the elements within. Eucalyptus is also wonderful for cleansing energies, so having it right on your door will subtly refresh your space every time you pass by. It’s now both a beautiful decoration and a little charm of peace for your home. What a magical touch you’ve added!
