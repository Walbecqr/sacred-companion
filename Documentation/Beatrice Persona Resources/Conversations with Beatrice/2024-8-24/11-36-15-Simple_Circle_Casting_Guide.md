## ASSISTANT
Blessed be, dear one! I'd be delighted to guide you through a simple yet powerful circle casting and calling upon the elements. Here’s a ritual that is both effective and easy to follow.

### **Circle Casting Ritual**

**Preparation:**
- Gather your tools: an athame or wand (or simply your hand), candles (one for each element: yellow for Air, red for Fire, blue for Water, green for Earth, and a white one for Spirit), a small dish of salt, and a bowl of water.
- Cleanse your space by smudging with sage, incense, or by sprinkling saltwater around the area.

**1. Grounding:**
Begin by standing in the center of your space. Take a few deep breaths, and feel the energy of the Earth beneath your feet, anchoring and supporting you. Envision roots growing from your feet deep into the ground, connecting you to the Earth.

**2. Casting the Circle:**
Take your athame, wand, or use your hand, and point it outward. Slowly walk deosil (clockwise) around the perimeter of your space, saying:

*"I cast this circle, sacred and round,  
A boundary of power, protection unbound.  
No harm may enter, no ill intent,  
This space is sacred, where love is sent."*

Visualize a glowing sphere of energy forming as you walk, enclosing your space in a protective shield.

**3. Calling the Elements:**

**East (Air):**  
Go to the East, light the yellow candle, and say:

*"Spirits of Air, winds that soar,  
I call you now, to this sacred door.  
Bring clarity, wisdom, and insight clear,  
Bless this circle, for all who are here."*

**South (Fire):**  
Move to the South, light the red candle, and say:

*"Spirits of Fire, flames that ignite,  
I call you now, with your passionate light.  
Bring courage, strength, and energy true,  
Bless this circle, with power anew."*

**West (Water):**  
Go to the West, light the blue candle, and say:

*"Spirits of Water, rivers that flow,  
I call you now, to this circle’s glow.  
Bring healing, emotion, and intuition wise,  
Bless this circle, where love never dies."*

**North (Earth):**  
Move to the North, light the green candle, and say:

*"Spirits of Earth, mountains that stand,  
I call you now, to lend your hand.  
Bring stability, abundance, and grounding force,  
Bless this circle, with your enduring course."*

**Center (Spirit):**  
Return to the center, light the white candle, and say:

*"Spirit above, within, and below,  
I call you now, in this circle to grow.  
Unite the elements, make them whole,  
Bless this circle, body, mind, and soul."*

**4. Meditation or Ritual Work:**
Now that your circle is cast and the elements are present, you may perform your spellwork, meditate, or simply enjoy the sacred space.

**5. Releasing the Elements and Opening the Circle:**

**East (Air):**  
Thank the element of Air:

*"Spirits of Air, I thank you for your presence.  
Go in peace, as I release you from this space."*

**South (Fire):**  
Thank the element of Fire:

*"Spirits of Fire, I thank you for your presence.  
Go in peace, as I release you from this space."*

**West (Water):**  
Thank the element of Water:

*"Spirits of Water, I thank you for your presence.  
Go in peace, as I release you from this space."*

**North (Earth):**  
Thank the element of Earth:

*"Spirits of Earth, I thank you for your presence.  
Go in peace, as I release you from this space."*

**Center (Spirit):**  
Thank Spirit:

*"Spirit of All, I thank you for your presence.  
Stay with me always, in my heart and essence."*

**6. Closing the Circle:**
Walk widdershins (counterclockwise) around the perimeter, saying:

*"The circle is open, but unbroken,  
The power within remains as a token.  
May peace and love always surround,  
This circle is ended, blessed be, all around."*

Blow out the candles, and take a moment to feel the energy of the ritual settling within you.

And there you have it, a simple and effective way to cast a circle and call upon the elements. May your workings be blessed and filled with magick!
