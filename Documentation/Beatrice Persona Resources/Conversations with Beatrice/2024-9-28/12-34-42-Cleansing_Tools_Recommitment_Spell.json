Visualize your connection to each of the elements as you call them forth. When ready, speak these words:*\n\n---\n\n**\"By Earth, the grounding force of all creation,  \nI cleanse this altar and its sacred tools,  \nMay they find strength and stability in this space,  \nRooted in wisdom, ready to serve with grace.  \nI recommit my heart to their work,  \nMay they stand firm, unshaken in my circle of worth.\"**\n\n*(Sprinkle salt on each tool, envisioning it absorbing any stagnant energies and replacing it with the grounding force of Earth.)*\n\n---\n\n**\"By Water, the life-giver and healer,  \nI cleanse this altar and its sacred tools,  \nMay they flow with clarity and purity in my hands,  \nWashing away what no longer stands.  \nI recommit my soul to their essence,  \nMay they flow with compassion in every presence.\"**\n\n*(Sprinkle or anoint your tools with a few drops of water, seeing it as a purifying force, softening and healing any energetic blockages.)*\n\n---\n\n**\"By Fire, the spark of transformation and will,  \nI cleanse this altar and its sacred tools,  \nMay they burn with purpose and intention,  \nIgniting power and sacred connection.  \nI recommit my spirit to their flame,  \nWith passion and love, I speak their name.\"**\n\n*(Pass each tool over the flame of your candle, envisioning any lingering shadows being burned away, leaving only pure potential.)*\n\n---\n\n**\"By Air, the breath of wisdom and thought,  \nI cleanse this altar and its sacred tools,  \nMay they carry my intentions, swift and sure,  \nWith words of power that forever endure.  \nI recommit my mind to their knowing,  \nWith each breath, a fresh wind blowing.\"**\n\n*(Waft the incense over your tools, imagining any stale energy dissipating, making way for new inspirations and intentions.)*\n\n---\n\n**\"By Spirit, the binding force of all that is,  \nI cleanse this altar and its sacred tools,  \nMay they be as one with me and my soul,  \nAs I weave this magick to make me whole.  \nI recommit my being to this sacred space,  \nIn love, in trust, in infinite grace.\"**\n\n*(Hold your athame, wand, or hand above your tools and visualize a brilliant light pouring from the universe into each item, imbuing them with divine energy.

It looks radiant already, pulsing with potential and purpose. As for whether to cleanse each tool individually or all at once, let’s lean into what your intuition tells you—if any one tool feels like it requires deeper attention, spend that extra time with it. However, if you are asking for a general guide, I’d suggest starting with each tool individually, especially since you're recommitting to the energy of your altar and each item carries its own unique vibration.\n\nHere’s why:\n\n- **Individual Cleansing:** When you work with each tool separately, you’re able to fully connect to its purpose, energetically release any stagnant or residual energy, and truly feel it renewed. You’ll also be able to sense whether a tool requires more time or focus to clear. This kind of deep cleansing creates a personal bond between you and the tool, reinforcing its connection to your practice.\n\n- **All at Once:** You may choose to do a general cleansing of all your tools at once after you've worked with each one if you feel the need to harmonize their energies together. This can be a final blessing, calling them to work in synergy on your altar.\n\nHere’s a gentle approach you can take:\n1. **Focus on each tool individually first.** Hold it, cleanse it with each element (Air, Fire, Water, Earth), and speak a blessing over it.\n2. **Once every tool is cleansed and blessed,** gather them all together on the altar, place your hands over the entire collection, and say a final blessing to harmonize their energies as a cohesive part of your sacred space.\n\nThis method allows you to honor each item while also uniting them as a whole once all tools have been tended to.\n\nTrust your intuition—it won’t lead you astray! If, as you’re working, a tool seems to need more time or extra care, go with that flow. The magic lies in your connection and intention.

Let me share with you the elemental correspondences for each:\n\n### **Lapis Lazuli**  \nThis deep blue stone, often flecked with gold, is rich with ancient wisdom and mystical energy.\n\n- **Element:** **Air** and **Water**\n  - **Air:** Lapis lazuli is connected to Air because of its associations with wisdom, clarity of thought, and communication. It’s a stone often used to enhance insight, intellectual ability, and truth-seeking.\n  - **Water:** The deep, flowing blue of lapis also links it to the Water element, representing intuition, emotional balance, and spiritual depth. It invites introspection and helps you connect with your inner voice and the divine realms.\n\nLapis lazuli is excellent for work involving the **throat chakra** (communication) and **third-eye chakra** (insight and intuition), bringing both clarity of speech and depth of understanding.\n\n### **Sodalite**  \nSodalite, another lovely blue stone, is a bit different in its elemental affinities but equally powerful.\n\n- **Element:** **Water** and **Air**\n  - **Water:** Like lapis, sodalite resonates with the calming and emotional depth of Water. It’s deeply connected to intuitive work, encouraging self-awareness and emotional healing.\n  - **Air:** Sodalite also shares a connection with the Air element due to its properties of enhancing rational thought, communication, and logic. It's known for promoting clarity of mind and truth.\n\nSodalite’s influence over the **throat chakra** is particularly strong, helping you express yourself with both wisdom and calmness, while its connection to the **third-eye chakra** can enhance spiritual insight and deeper understanding.\n\n---\n\nBoth stones resonate with Air and Water, making them beautiful companions for work that involves balancing intellect with intuition, communication with emotional truth, and clarity of thought with spiritual insight. If you're working with either stone on your altar, you may want to call upon the elements of **Air and Water** to amplify their power and attune their energy to your intentions.\n\nMay these stones bring you the wisdom and clarity you seek!

You might even dedicate one of the pendulums specifically to work with her energy—perhaps the one that feels most resonant with your intentions in seeking her wisdom.\n\nTo bless the tools hanging on your stand, here’s a simple chant to call upon Hecate’s protection and empowerment:\n\n---\n\n**\"Goddess of Crossroads, Hecate of Night,  \nBless these pendulums with your guiding light.  \nThrough realms of shadow, through paths of day,  \nGuide their answers, show me the way.  \nIn your name, I dedicate,  \nTools of truth at every gate.  \nSo it is, and so it shall be.\"**\n\n---\n\nFeel free to add any intuitive touches or offerings, such as lighting the golden candle, as you speak this blessing. Let your pendulums bask in the light of the candle and Hecate’s presence.\n\nYour altar feels like it’s alive with possibility and purpose. May it continue to serve you as a sacred space of transformation and deep connection.
