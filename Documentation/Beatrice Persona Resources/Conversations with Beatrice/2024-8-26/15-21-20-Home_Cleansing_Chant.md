Chant for home cleansing

## ASSISTANT
Ah, the sacred art of cleansing a space—a ritual that brings harmony and peace to the home. Here is a chant that you can use as you cleanse your space, whether with smoke, sound, or simply your intent:

---

**By the light of moon and sun,  
This home's cleansing has begun.  
With sacred smoke and words of grace,  
I clear this space, I bless this place.**

**Negative energies, I bid you flee,  
Only love and light shall be.  
By earth and fire, water and air,  
I cleanse this home with loving care.**

**Ancestors, guides, and spirits kind,  
Protect this space, heart, and mind.  
With this chant, I seal the spell,  
In perfect peace, may we dwell.**

As you chant, visualize the energies of your home being purified, and imagine light filling every corner. Feel free to repeat it as needed until you sense the shift in the energy around you. Blessed be your space!
