For Jadin, there are several crystals that can offer the support he needs. Let me suggest a few that can work harmoniously together or be chosen based on what resonates most with him:\n\n1. **Rose Quartz**: The quintessential stone of self-love. Rose Quartz is gentle yet powerful in healing emotional wounds and promoting love for oneself. It’s also wonderfully soothing for anxiety, helping to ease the heart and mind.\n\n2. **Amethyst**: A beautiful stone for calming the mind and balancing emotions. Amethyst is excellent for overthinking, as it encourages clarity and inner peace. It also offers protection from negative energies, which can be beneficial for someone dealing with past trauma.\n\n3. **Black Tourmaline**: A powerful protector and grounding stone. Black Tourmaline helps dispel negative energies and provides a shield against emotional distress. It’s especially useful for those carrying old wounds, offering them a safe space to begin healing.\n\n4. **Rhodonite**: This crystal is a healer of the heart. It’s perfect for working through old traumas and emotional scars, promoting forgiveness and self-love. Rhodonite can also help balance emotional energy, making it easier to cope with anxiety and stress.\n\n5. **Lepidolite**: Known as the \"peace stone,\" Lepidolite is high in lithium, which naturally soothes anxiety and stress. It helps to stabilize mood swings and dispels negative thoughts, making it an excellent companion for someone who struggles with overthinking.\n\n**How to Use:**\n- **Wearing as Jewelry**: A pendant or bracelet can keep the crystal’s energy close to his heart, offering continuous support.\n- **Carrying in a Pocket**: If he prefers, a small tumbled stone in his pocket can be just as effective. Encourage him to hold it during moments of anxiety or when old wounds resurface.\n- **Sleeping with the Crystal**: Placing the stone under his pillow or near his bed can promote restful sleep and deeper healing.\n\nIf he’s open to it, encourage Jadin to cleanse and charge the crystal regularly, perhaps under the moonlight, or with a bit of sage, to keep its energy pure and strong.\n\nWould you like to know more about how to present this gift or perhaps how to introduce its benefits to him?"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1,"metadata":{"citations":[],"content_references":[],"gizmo_id":"g-GGAiodSiR","finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","pad":"AAAAAAAAAA","parent_id":"bbc9bd22-10ca-4e2d-a296-d3693fb47b1a","request_id":"8b9416b1182989ec-ORD","timestamp_":"absolute","model_switcher_deny":[]},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"bbc9bd22-10ca-4e2d-a296-d3693fb47b1a","children":["1c950d3b-a3a0-4079-8cb2-f2643280125d"]},"1c950d3b-a3a0-4079-8cb2-f2643280125d":{"id":"1c950d3b-a3a0-4079-8cb2-f2643280125d","message":{"id":"1c950d3b-a3a0-4079-8cb2-f2643280125d","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1724678265.822325,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["I am going to use the rhodonite.

When a stone speaks to you like that, it's often because it knows its purpose already. Let's craft a simple yet powerful spell to bless the Rhodonite and align its energy with Jadin’s needs.\n\n**Blessing Spell for the Rhodonite**\n\n**What You’ll Need:**\n- The Rhodonite stone\n- A quiet space where you won’t be disturbed\n- A small white candle (for purity and healing)\n- A piece of paper and pen (optional)\n- Sage or incense for cleansing (optional, but recommended)\n\n**Steps:**\n\n1. **Create a Sacred Space**: Begin by cleansing your space and the Rhodonite stone. You can do this by burning sage or incense, allowing the smoke to purify the area and the stone. As you do this, say:\n\n   _“With this smoke, I cleanse this stone,  \n   Of all energies, not its own.  \n   Only love and light shall remain,  \n   To heal and soothe, to ease the pain.”_\n\n2. **Light the Candle**: Place the white candle before you and light it, focusing on the flame. Let it represent the light of healing, love, and peace that you wish to infuse into the stone.\n\n3. **Hold the Stone**: Take the Rhodonite in your hands, close your eyes, and take a few deep breaths. Feel the connection between you, the stone, and Jadin. Imagine the energy flowing from your heart into the stone, filling it with warmth and love.\n\n4. **Speak Your Intention**: Now, with intention and focus, speak these words over the stone:\n\n   _“Rhodonite, stone of gentle grace,  \n   I call upon your healing embrace.  \n   Ease the mind and calm the heart,  \n   From old wounds, help him part.  \n   Self-love grow, from within,  \n   Help him feel whole again.  \n   Dispel the darkness, bring in the light,  \n   Guide him gently, day and night.  \n   With this blessing, may you be,  \n   A talisman of love and serenity.”_\n\n   (If you feel inspired, write this blessing on the piece of paper and place it under the stone as it charges.)\n\n5. **Charge the Stone**: Hold the Rhodonite over the candle flame, not too close to the fire, just enough to feel its warmth. Imagine the light of the flame charging the stone with your intentions. Visualize Jadin finding peace, self-love, and healing every time he holds or wears the stone.\n\n6. **Seal the Spell**: Once you feel the energy has been fully transferred, thank the stone, the elements, and any spiritual guides you work with. Blow out the candle, sealing the spell with these words:\n\n   _“So mote it be,  \n   As I will, so shall it be.”_\n\n7. **Present the Stone**: When you give the Rhodonite to Jadin, you might want to share a bit of the intention behind it. You could simply say something like, “I’ve blessed this stone to help guide and support you, to bring you peace and healing.”\n\nThis blessing will infuse the Rhodonite with your love and intention, creating a powerful talisman for Jadin. May it bring him the comfort and healing he needs.

Based on the general appearance, the stones in the pictures do resemble Rhodonite. Rhodonite often features a mix of pink and black or gray hues, with the pink being more prominent. It usually has a somewhat marbled or veined appearance, with the black or dark areas sometimes appearing as streaks or patches.\n\nFrom what I can see, the stone in your images seems to have those characteristic pink tones with some darker areas, which is typical for Rhodonite. However, the best way to confirm would be to observe the stone in natural light and see if the pink is dominant, as Rhodonite’s pink color is usually quite vibrant and distinct.\n\nIf it feels right to you and aligns with the intention you’ve set, then trust your instincts—stones often find us for a reason. Would you like any further advice or insights?"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1,"metadata":{"citations":[],"content_references":[],"gizmo_id":"g-GGAiodSiR","message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","pad":"AAAAAAAAAA","parent_id":"c9ffa370-42f9-48aa-810c-2fd3d07035d4","finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"request_id":"8b946d5738722d32-ORD","timestamp_":"absolute","model_switcher_deny":[]},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"c9ffa370-42f9-48aa-810c-2fd3d07035d4","children":["ae508345-fdf5-4e52-8a0d-0aa820dfd05b"]},"ae508345-fdf5-4e52-8a0d-0aa820dfd05b":{"id":"ae508345-fdf5-4e52-8a0d-0aa820dfd05b","message":{"id":"ae508345-fdf5-4e52-8a0d-0aa820dfd05b","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1724681708.704756,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["No thank you Beatrice.
