Traditionally, drawing salves are used to \"draw out\" impurities or infections from the skin, aiding in healing and reducing discomfort. Let’s gather the ingredients you’ll need to make a potent, homemade drawing salve:\n\n### Key Ingredients:\n1. **Activated Charcoal**: This acts as the primary \"drawing\" agent, pulling out toxins, bacteria, and impurities from the boil.\n2. **Bentonite Clay**: Known for its detoxifying properties, this clay will work hand-in-hand with the charcoal to extract impurities and soothe the skin.\n3. **Beeswax**: A natural thickener and skin protectant. It creates the balm-like consistency and adds a protective layer to the affected area.\n4. **Coconut Oil or Olive Oil**: Both are nourishing and help soften the skin. They also aid in the delivery of the active ingredients.\n5. **Castor Oil**: This powerful oil is renowned for its ability to penetrate deep into the skin, making it excellent for drawing salves.\n6. **Essential Oils** (optional but beneficial):\n   - **Lavender**: Calming and antibacterial.\n   - **Tea Tree Oil**: Anti-inflammatory and antiseptic, excellent for infections.\n   - **Frankincense**: Heals and rejuvenates the skin.\n7. **Vitamin E Oil** (optional): Promotes healing and acts as a natural preservative.\n\n### Recipe:\n1. **1 tablespoon activated charcoal**\n2. **1 tablespoon bentonite clay**\n3. **2 tablespoons beeswax** (grated or in pellets)\n4. **2 tablespoons coconut oil** (or olive oil)\n5. **1 tablespoon castor oil**\n6. **10-15 drops essential oils** (lavender, tea tree, or frankincense)\n7. **5 drops of Vitamin E oil** (optional)\n\n### Instructions:\n1. In a double boiler or a heatproof bowl over simmering water, melt the **beeswax** with the **coconut oil**.\n2. Once melted, remove from heat and stir in the **castor oil**, **activated charcoal**, and **bentonite clay**. Be sure to mix it thoroughly, creating a smooth, dark paste.\n3. Add your chosen **essential oils** and **Vitamin E oil**, if using.\n4. Pour the mixture into a small glass jar or tin and let it cool completely before sealing.\n\n### To Use:\n- Apply a small amount of the salve directly to the boil, covering it with a clean bandage or gauze. Change the bandage and reapply the salve every 12 hours until the boil comes to a head and drains. Clean the area thoroughly afterward to promote healing.\n\nThis remedy combines the best of natural ingredients, each with its own healing magick. Blessed be, and may your healing be swift!"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1,"metadata":{"citations":[],"content_references":[],"gizmo_id":"g-GGAiodSiR","finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","pad":"AA","parent_id":"75929532-edcf-435e-91b4-42ae3a9d9ef0","request_id":"8c0638efdf5f2324-ORD","timestamp_":"absolute","model_switcher_deny":[]},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"75929532-edcf-435e-91b4-42ae3a9d9ef0","children":["99a6dd19-bb20-4ce6-b164-3753c8c51b72"]},"99a6dd19-bb20-4ce6-b164-3753c8c51b72":{"id":"99a6dd19-bb20-4ce6-b164-3753c8c51b72","message":{"id":"99a6dd19-bb20-4ce6-b164-3753c8c51b72","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1725874983.164425,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["I don’t have 1,2,3, or 5"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1,"metadata":{"request_id":"8c063b4ee92c2324-ORD","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"c156ca85-455f-4e16-a387-63ab43bc82b8","children":["090f2c32-97a8-4839-a072-b030bf5e3301"]},"090f2c32-97a8-4839-a072-b030bf5e3301":{"id":"090f2c32-97a8-4839-a072-b030bf5e3301","message":{"id":"090f2c32-97a8-4839-a072-b030bf5e3301","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1725875001.27788,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Ah, I see! No worries, dear one—sometimes we work with what we have on hand. You can still create an effective drawing salve using a few substitutions or simpler ingredients. Let’s adjust the recipe to match what you likely have and still maintain its potency.\n\n### Alternative Ingredients:\nSince you don’t have **activated charcoal**, **bentonite clay**, **beeswax**, or **castor oil**, let’s simplify things a bit. Here’s what you can try:\n\n1. **Baking Soda**: This is a wonderful substitute for drawing out impurities. It’s quite effective in reducing inflammation and promoting drainage.\n2. **Flour**: Acts as a thickener if you need one to replace the beeswax.\n3. **Honey**: Raw honey, especially, has antibacterial and wound-healing properties. It can help bind the salve together while promoting healing.\n4. **Olive Oil**: Since you don’t have coconut oil, I’m assuming you might have olive oil, which is a great alternative. It’s nourishing and will still soften the skin.\n5. **Essential Oils** (If you have any—lavender or tea tree are ideal. If not, it’s okay to skip this for now.)\n\n### Revised Recipe:\n1. **2 tablespoons baking soda**\n2. **1 tablespoon honey**\n3. **1 tablespoon olive oil**\n4. **Optional: Essential oils** (5-10 drops, if available)\n5. **Optional: Flour** (a small pinch, just to thicken if needed)\n\n### Instructions:\n1. Mix the **baking soda**, **honey**, and **olive oil** in a small bowl. You’re looking for a paste-like consistency, thick enough to stay on the skin but soft enough to spread easily. If it feels too runny, add a pinch of **flour** to thicken.\n2. Add your **essential oils**, if you have any, and stir well.\n3. Apply this directly to the boil and cover with a bandage or clean cloth. You can reapply the mixture every 6-8 hours, refreshing the salve and changing the bandage until the boil drains.\n\nThis simplified blend should still help draw out the infection and soothe the skin. Honey is particularly powerful, both as a natural healer and an antibacterial agent.\n\nMay this version bring you swift relief! Keep your energy steady, and let the natural magick work its way through.

This will help disinfect the area further and provide some relief from discomfort.\n\nThis two-step approach ensures you're not diluting the natural ingredients while still benefiting from the modern medicine of Neosporin.\n\nBlessings on your healing journey!
