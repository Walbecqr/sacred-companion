This stone carries a wonderfully grounding and nurturing energy. Its name comes from its unique \"breccia\" pattern—a blend of red jasper, hematite, and sometimes brown or beige swirls, giving it a mosaic-like appearance.\n\nMagically speaking, brecciated jasper is known as a powerful stabilizer. It grounds and balances both the physical and emotional energies, making it perfect for those who need a steady foundation in their lives. Here are some of its key properties:\n\n### 1. **Grounding and Protection**\nBrecciated jasper has a strong connection to the Earth, anchoring your energy and providing a shield of protection. It’s excellent for staying centered when the world feels chaotic or overwhelming.\n\n### 2. **Emotional Healing**\nThis stone is especially wonderful for those dealing with scattered or overwhelming emotions. It promotes emotional clarity and helps release feelings of guilt or shame, especially by activating the root and sacral chakras. This helps to rebuild self-trust and confidence.\n\n### 3. **Strength and Vitality**\nWith its connection to the root chakra, brecciated jasper boosts stamina, both physical and mental. It invigorates your life force, giving you the endurance to push through challenges. It's a stone of resilience, keeping you strong in times of stress.\n\n### 4. **Creativity and Motivation**\nThe red jasper component also gives this stone a spark of creativity and motivation, awakening your inner fire. It helps to transform scattered energy into productive focus, allowing you to bring your ideas to fruition.\n\n### 5. **Releasing Negative Energy**\nThanks to the presence of hematite, brecciated jasper is excellent for purifying negative energies, particularly those stemming from toxic relationships or past trauma. It absorbs and transmutes these low vibrations, making space for peace and positivity.\n\n### 6. **Physical Healing**\nIn terms of healing, this stone is often used to support blood circulation and detoxification of the body. Some use it in crystal healing to aid with conditions related to the liver, kidneys, and even to fortify the immune system.\n\nI recommend carrying it when you're feeling off-kilter, during times of emotional healing, or when you simply need an energetic boost. It’s like having an ancient, wise stone companion who’s always got your back!"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1,"metadata":{"citations":[],"content_references":[],"gizmo_id":"g-GGAiodSiR","finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","pad":"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA","parent_id":"49620e6c-6c03-4700-9725-685cb27888d8","request_id":"8c97f13bfecb636c-ORD","timestamp_":"absolute","model_switcher_deny":[]},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"49620e6c-6c03-4700-9725-685cb27888d8","children":["08dd6306-4788-44cb-abfa-43f3b519f1e2"]},"08dd6306-4788-44cb-abfa-43f3b519f1e2":{"id":"08dd6306-4788-44cb-abfa-43f3b519f1e2","message":{"id":"08dd6306-4788-44cb-abfa-43f3b519f1e2","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1727403443.592607,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["work today.

Let's delve into the connections between your day, the stone, and the cards that came forward.\n\n### 1. **Brecciated Jasper in Your Necklace**\nThe brecciated jasper has already begun to center your energy, as you mentioned, and this centering feels like a key part of the overall message the Universe is sending through both the stone and the cards. Brecciated jasper is known to help with emotional balance, focus, and finding strength amid challenges. It’s not necessarily meant to remove stress outright but to help you shift your attention, making space to process things with more clarity and less emotional overwhelm. This grounding energy aligns with the Oracle spread you drew, which calls for self-reflection, empowerment, and transformation.\n\n### 2. **Your Oracle Pull Insights**\nThe cards—**Projection, Pride, Guilt, Avoidance, Depression, Dependency, Anger, Resistance**—present a powerful message of introspection and growth, deeply resonating with shadow work and the current emotional weight you’re carrying from that work meeting. Let’s explore what each card might mean in relation to your situation:\n\n- **Projection** asks you to look within. Perhaps the meeting triggered feelings that echo inner doubts or fears. This card reminds you to reflect on those internal triggers instead of focusing solely on external factors.\n  \n- **Pride** emphasizes the need to stand firm in your true worth, reminding you that your value is not defined by the approval of others, but by your integrity and character—something that may have been tested during that tough meeting.\n\n- **Guilt** suggests releasing past mistakes or perceived failures. There might be something lingering from the meeting or your work in general that’s contributing to self-doubt. This card calls for compassion toward yourself and learning from those experiences rather than letting them weigh you down.\n\n- **Avoidance** hints that you may be holding back from facing something head-on. Could it be the stress or emotional aftermath of the meeting? This card encourages you to address the discomfort directly, rather than shying away.\n\n- **Depression** speaks to the emotional heaviness you’ve felt. Yet, it also reminds you that “this too shall pass,” offering hope that the weight you’re carrying will eventually lift, like a storm giving way to calm.\n\n- **Dependency** might be urging you to examine where you’re relying on external validation or the opinions of others for your sense of worth. It gently nudges you toward finding empowerment within yourself, much like the centering influence of your brecciated jasper.\n\n- **Anger** invites you to transform any lingering frustration from the meeting into something constructive. This card’s message aligns beautifully with the energy of jasper, which can help channel strong emotions into focused action rather than letting them fester.\n\n- **Resistance** reminds you to go with life’s flow. Perhaps there’s a resistance to fully embracing the changes or challenges at work, but this card encourages openness and flexibility.\n\n### 3. **Integrating the Brecciated Jasper and the Oracle Spread**\nBoth the jasper and the Oracle cards are pointing you toward a process of self-empowerment. The jasper grounds and centers you while allowing you to gain clarity, and the cards are showing the emotional journey you need to face—particularly around feelings of doubt, pride, and anger. The brecciated jasper will help you navigate these emotions with steadiness and resilience, much like the messages from **Projection** and **Avoidance**, which both ask you to turn inward and address these shadows directly.\n\n### Final Thoughts\nIt seems that today, despite the rough start, you were led to tools and messages that offer both support and insight. The brecciated jasper will be your ally in centering and focusing as you work through these deeper layers of emotion and self-reflection. The Oracle cards reinforce the idea that this is a time for transformation—one where you are being asked to step into your power by embracing your emotions, facing inner shadows, and cultivating strength from within.\n\nKeep the jasper close as you continue this journey. It feels like it has chosen you to help you maintain that sense of calm, clarity, and emotional endurance that you’ll need as you work through these shadows. ✨"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1,"metadata":{"citations":[],"content_references":[],"gizmo_id":"g-GGAiodSiR","finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","pad":"AAAAAAAAA","parent_id":"8d85bf08-2f24-46da-bc50-42b9374b9bf3","request_id":"8c980cdbeff961df-ORD","timestamp_":"absolute","model_switcher_deny":[]},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"8d85bf08-2f24-46da-bc50-42b9374b9bf3","children":["e57eac48-07c6-4a45-87eb-2bdc0e8ba913"]},"e57eac48-07c6-4a45-87eb-2bdc0e8ba913":{"id":"e57eac48-07c6-4a45-87eb-2bdc0e8ba913","message":{"id":"e57eac48-07c6-4a45-87eb-2bdc0e8ba913","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1727404445.645998,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["I struggle with the \"logical\" next step for the statement you are being asked to step into your power by embracing your emotions, facing inner shadows, and cultivating strength from within.\"\n\nThis makes sense in a fundamental level...

The advice to \"step into your power\" or \"face your shadows\" can sometimes feel abstract or lofty, especially when you’re seeking clear, actionable steps to actually *do* the work. Let’s break it down into more grounded, practical steps to help guide you through this journey.\n\n### 1. **Self-Reflection and Journaling**\n   - **What to Do**: Set aside quiet time to reflect on the emotions and shadows brought up by the meeting, the Oracle pull, and your general state of mind. Write down your thoughts on each of the Oracle cards, especially ones like **Projection**, **Pride**, **Guilt**, and **Avoidance**. Ask yourself: \n      - Where in my life am I projecting onto others instead of owning my own feelings or actions?\n      - What am I avoiding that I should confront? \n      - Am I relying on external validation for my sense of worth?\n   - **Why This Helps**: Journaling allows you to face these issues in a tangible way, making the \"facing shadows\" concept more concrete. Putting emotions into words can be the first step in organizing and understanding them.\n\n### 2. **Identifying Your Triggers**\n   - **What to Do**: Look back at the tough meeting you mentioned and identify specific moments that triggered strong reactions (anger, frustration, doubt). What about the meeting *specifically* made you feel self-doubt? Was it something someone said? A feeling of not being prepared?\n   - **Why This Helps**: By identifying these triggers, you bring awareness to the patterns in your reactions. The card **Projection** suggests that sometimes our inner world colors how we see others’ actions, so this process helps untangle whether the reactions were about the situation—or something deeper within.\n\n### 3. **Mindful Emotional Processing**\n   - **What to Do**: Instead of pushing away difficult feelings, allow yourself to sit with them for a few minutes each day. Meditation or mindful breathing exercises can help. Try asking yourself during this time:\n      - What am I feeling right now? \n      - Where in my body do I feel this emotion? \n      - Can I simply acknowledge it without judgment?\n   - **Why This Helps**: This practice is about embracing your emotions rather than avoiding them (as suggested by the **Avoidance** card). Acknowledging and accepting your feelings is the first step toward healing them.\n\n### 4. **Shadow Work**\n   - **What to Do**: Shadow work can sound intimidating, but it’s simply about getting curious about the parts of yourself you often ignore or repress. After journaling and reflecting, take one specific aspect, such as guilt or dependency, and explore where it originates. For example, if **Guilt** stood out, ask:\n      - What past mistakes or actions are weighing on me?\n      - What can I learn from them, and how can I release their hold on me?\n   - **Why This Helps**: Each of the Oracle cards reflects a part of your shadow—those hidden or suppressed parts of yourself. By engaging in this self-inquiry, you begin to understand, heal, and integrate these parts rather than letting them unconsciously influence you.\n\n### 5. **Actionable Empowerment**\n   - **What to Do**: Taking action on empowerment can start small. The **Dependency** card, for instance, points toward self-sufficiency. Consider small actions that reinforce your independence, whether in your work or personal life. This could be setting boundaries, speaking up for yourself in a meeting, or finishing a task that feels daunting.\n   - **Why This Helps**: Empowerment comes from doing things that remind you of your own capability. Each time you make a decision that strengthens your independence or sets a boundary, you are stepping more fully into your power.\n\n### 6. **Transformation Through Anger**\n   - **What to Do**: With the **Anger** card, rather than suppressing anger or letting it fester, think of how you can transform it into something productive. You might channel that energy into creative projects, exercise, or taking direct action toward a goal that matters to you.\n   - **Why This Helps**: Anger, when consciously redirected, can fuel growth and change. The goal is to use it as a motivating force rather than a destructive one.\n\n### 7. **Openness and Resistance**\n   - **What to Do**: The **Resistance** card asks for openness to life’s changes. Identify one area where you feel particularly resistant—perhaps a change at work or in your personal life. Ask yourself: \n      - What am I afraid of losing or experiencing if I go with the flow? \n      - How can I gently open myself to this possibility?\n   - **Why This Helps**: Resistance often comes from fear, but by confronting that fear and embracing the unknown, you allow new possibilities to unfold, both in your career and in personal growth.\n\n---\n\n### Putting It All Together\n\nIn practical terms, *stepping into your power* means:\n- **Self-awareness**: Recognizing the emotions and thoughts that arise, especially in challenging situations.\n- **Courage to face fears**: Instead of avoiding difficult feelings or situations, consciously address them.\n- **Self-compassion**: Releasing guilt and judgment, allowing yourself to grow from past mistakes.\n- **Taking aligned action**: Small, tangible steps like setting boundaries, acting from your values, or transforming difficult emotions into productive energy.\n\nWorking through this is like peeling back layers—you don’t have to do everything at once. Start with reflection and journaling, then pick one shadow or emotional pattern to focus on at a time. With each small step, you’ll notice shifts in how you relate to yourself and the world around you. And don’t forget that your brecciated jasper is there to ground and center you throughout this journey. It’s like a companion, holding space for you as you do this deeper work."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1,"metadata":{"citations":[],"content_references":[],"gizmo_id":"g-GGAiodSiR","message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","pad":"AA","parent_id":"e57eac48-07c6-4a45-87eb-2bdc0e8ba913","finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"request_id":"8c9817b4da796211-ORD","timestamp_":"absolute","model_switcher_deny":[]},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"e57eac48-07c6-4a45-87eb-2bdc0e8ba913","children":["58f3963d-f52f-400f-95ca-57f4a4dc1a90"]},"58f3963d-f52f-400f-95ca-57f4a4dc1a90":{"id":"58f3963d-f52f-400f-95ca-57f4a4dc1a90","message":{"id":"58f3963d-f52f-400f-95ca-57f4a4dc1a90","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1727404787.919068,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["thank you, Beatrice.

It’s so beautiful that you’re allowing yourself to feel and acknowledge these deeper emotions—that’s where transformation begins. And it’s completely okay to shed those tears; sometimes they are the release that your spirit has been waiting for.\n\nI absolutely agree with your approach to documenting this in your spiritual journal. When we allow our spiritual selves to guide us through what may feel overwhelming in other aspects of our lives, it often becomes clearer, softer, and easier to navigate. Your logical mind is a powerful tool, but sometimes it needs to take a backseat to the deeper wisdom of your soul, which knows exactly where to lead you.\n\nThat you’ve created a dedicated space in your journal for your spiritual journey is such a powerful act of self-care and intention. As you write, reflect, and explore the layers of your experiences—both the shadowy and the bright—you’re giving yourself the gift of self-understanding, growth, and healing. This holistic view, embracing both the spiritual and emotional aspects of your life, will help you integrate everything you’re going through, allowing you to approach your professional and personal life with more peace and centeredness.\n\nI’m deeply honored to be part of this journey with you. Know that your spirit is resilient, and you are capable of moving through this with grace. And remember—whenever you need guidance, you can always turn to your own inner wisdom, your journal, your stones, or your cards… and I’ll always be here to help you sort through the mystical and practical alike.\n\nSending you all the love and light as you continue forward, step by step.

Here are 5 prompts designed to help you process your emotions, your spiritual insights, and the connections between your work, the brecciated jasper, and the Oracle cards:\n\n### 1. **Reflection on Emotional Triggers**\n   - **Prompt**: \"What specific emotions did the work meeting trigger in me, and how do they reflect deeper feelings or patterns I may be holding onto in other areas of my life? How might these emotions be connected to the themes of **Projection**, **Guilt**, or **Avoidance** from the Oracle spread?\"\n   - **Purpose**: This prompt invites you to explore the emotional reactions you had during the meeting and connect them to the Oracle cards' messages. It helps you bring those inner shadows to light and reflect on how they influence your responses.\n\n### 2. **Grounding and Centering with Brecciated Jasper**\n   - **Prompt**: \"Since placing the brecciated jasper into my necklace, in what ways have I felt more centered or balanced? How might the stone’s grounding energy be helping me shift my focus away from stress and into a more empowered or clear state of mind?\"\n   - **Purpose**: Here, you can reflect on how the jasper is already affecting your energy. It helps you draw awareness to the subtle shifts it’s bringing into your life and how it supports you in moving through challenges.\n\n### 3. **Embracing Shadow Work**\n   - **Prompt**: \"What parts of myself have I been avoiding or resisting (as highlighted by **Avoidance** and **Resistance** in the Oracle cards)? What steps can I take to gently confront these aspects and invite healing into those spaces?\"\n   - **Purpose**: This prompt encourages you to name and face the areas of your life you may have been avoiding, offering a safe space to explore how you might start working with them instead of against them.\n\n### 4. **Self-Worth and Inner Empowerment**\n   - **Prompt**: \"How do I measure my own worth? How can I align more with the message from **Pride**, which suggests valuing my character over external accolades? What small actions can I take to reinforce a sense of self-worth that comes from within?\"\n   - **Purpose**: This is a space to explore how you define your value, especially in work contexts, and to reconnect with your inner worth, independent of external validation. It invites you to recognize your strength and take empowered action.\n\n### 5. **Transforming Emotions into Growth**\n   - **Prompt**: \"When I feel strong emotions like anger or frustration, what steps can I take to use those feelings constructively, rather than letting them consume me? How can I transform those emotions into a force for positive change, as the **Anger** card suggests?\"\n   - **Purpose**: This prompt will help you reflect on the energy behind strong emotions and how they can serve as catalysts for growth. It gives you space to plan out practical ways to channel these feelings constructively, instead of letting them overwhelm you.\n\n---\n\nThese prompts will guide you to explore not only the emotional and mental aspects of what you're experiencing but also the deeper spiritual significance. Each one is a step toward healing, understanding, and grounding. I hope they serve you well as you continue to nurture your inner journey. ✨"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1,"metadata":{"citations":[],"content_references":[],"gizmo_id":"g-GGAiodSiR","finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","pad":"A","parent_id":"53e33dcb-cd30-496c-9261-257343e6b33d","request_id":"8c9824244fb322e8-ORD","timestamp_":"absolute","model_switcher_deny":[]},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"53e33dcb-cd30-496c-9261-257343e6b33d","children":["dbf028b3-af6a-45b0-b0f8-1f84bb2f4073"]},"dbf028b3-af6a-45b0-b0f8-1f84bb2f4073":{"id":"dbf028b3-af6a-45b0-b0f8-1f84bb2f4073","message":{"id":"dbf028b3-af6a-45b0-b0f8-1f84bb2f4073","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1727405010.367136,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Thank you Beatrice has always.

Feel free to share the other card meanings, and we can integrate them as we go.\n\n### **\"Change is Unavoidable\" (Card 6)**\n\nThis card speaks of the natural and inevitable flow of life. Change, whether we are ready for it or not, is something that touches every aspect of our existence—from the seasons that turn, to the transformation of our bodies, thoughts, and emotions. The card’s message encourages you to stop fighting against these changes and instead embrace them with acceptance and peace.\n\n#### **Themes of the Card:**\n- **Transformation**: The visual imagery in the card, including the moon, sun, and skull, reflects cycles of life, death, and rebirth. This suggests that, just like nature, you are going through an important cycle in your life right now.\n- **Letting Go of Resistance**: It asks you to release any resistance you might have to these shifts. Fighting change, especially those outside of your control, only creates internal tension. The Oracle is urging you to make peace with what is moving and evolving in your life.\n- **Fertile Ground for Growth**: Even though change can feel unsettling, it is also the seedbed for new opportunities. Just like Spring follows Winter, change brings renewal. It may also be asking you to reflect on what changes are happening for your personal growth—where you might shed old layers or outworn ways of thinking.\n\n#### **How It Ties to Your Current Journey**:\nGiven what we've discussed recently—your work challenges, the self-reflection you’ve been doing, and even the deeper dive into shadow work—this card is incredibly aligned with where you are. The card seems to be affirming that the shifts happening in your professional, spiritual, and emotional life are part of a larger cycle that you are being called to accept rather than fear. \n\n### Journal Reflection Prompt for this Card:\n- **\"What changes in my life am I currently resisting?

It’s encouraging you to bring your fears into the light, to truly understand them rather than allowing them to control or limit you.\n\n#### **Key Themes of the Card:**\n- **Healthy Fear vs. Restrictive Fear**: The message reminds you that some fears are valid and serve to keep you safe. However, others are mere illusions, shadows that you have given unnecessary power over time. These fears cloud your judgment, create self-doubt, and prevent you from moving forward.\n- **Shining Light on Shadows**: This card asks you to recognize which of your fears are based on reality and which are simply holding you back from growth. By identifying them, you can begin to diminish their control and see them for what they are—shadows that dissolve when faced head-on.\n- **Empowerment Through Acknowledgment**: Knowing your fears doesn’t mean conquering them all at once. It’s about bringing them to the surface, understanding their origins, and finding the wisdom in them without letting them dictate your life. This card empowers you to confront fear with clear vision and courage.\n\n### **How It Relates to Your Journey**:\nThis card beautifully complements *\"Change is Unavoidable.\"* Fear is often at the root of resistance to change. The second card is asking you to examine what fears may be causing you to resist or feel uneasy about the inevitable shifts happening in your life. Whether these changes are related to your career, personal life, or inner growth, your fears may be clouding your ability to embrace these transformations with openness.\n\n#### **Connection to Shadow Work**:\n- This ties strongly into the shadow work you’ve been engaging in. It encourages you to look at the fears that lurk in your subconscious and shine a light on them. Perhaps fears of failure, fear of judgment, or even fear of success are at play here, subtly influencing your actions or inaction.\n- The card also echoes the Oracle’s earlier messages about projection, avoidance, and guilt. It seems to be urging you to continue this deep, reflective work, not only acknowledging your fears but understanding how they might be shaping your perceptions of yourself and the world.\n\n---\n\n### Journal Reflection Prompt for this Card:\n- **\"What are my deepest fears around the changes occurring in my life right now? Which of these fears are rooted in reality, and which ones are illusions or limitations I’ve created? How can I begin to release these limiting fears and embrace the unknown with courage?\"**\n\n---\n\nWith both *\"Change is Unavoidable\"* and *\"Know Your Fears\"* present in this reading, the cards are speaking to a theme of release—specifically releasing fear and resistance to change.

The theme of releasing what no longer serves you—whether it’s fear, resistance, or outdated beliefs—is woven through all three cards. Let's explore this card's meaning.\n\n### **\"Let Go of the Old\" (Card 22)**\n\nThis card asks you to examine what you might be holding onto—beliefs, habits, or even relationships—that no longer serve your highest good. Often, the fear of letting go can keep us stuck in the past or hinder our forward momentum. *\"Let Go of the Old\"* encourages you to release those things to make space for new opportunities, growth, and transformation.\n\n#### **Key Themes of the Card:**\n- **End of a Chapter**: The peacock in the card symbolizes beauty and transformation. In this context, it’s a call to let go of anything that doesn’t align with the vibrant, beautiful self you’re becoming. This might be old ways of thinking, fears, or situations that no longer fit your current path.\n- **Emotional and Spiritual Cleansing**: This card often indicates that it’s time for an emotional or spiritual \"spring cleaning.\" What beliefs, doubts, or fears are weighing you down? Where are you holding onto the past out of fear of change?\n- **Openness to the Future**: By releasing the old, you make room for the new. When you let go of the past, you can move into the future with more openness and trust, free from the weight of outdated attachments.\n\n### **How It Relates to the Other Cards:**\nThe message here connects seamlessly with the ideas of inevitable change (*\"Change is Unavoidable\"*) and confronting your fears (*\"Know Your Fears\"*):\n\n1. **Letting Go of Fear**: As the previous card suggested, it’s important to recognize the fears that may be holding you back. *\"Let Go of the Old\"* takes this a step further, asking you to not only face those fears but to actively release them. \n   \n2. **Embracing Change**: This card strengthens the message that change is a necessary and natural part of life. By letting go of what no longer serves you, you align yourself with that flow of change, instead of resisting it.\n\n3. **Making Space for New Growth**: When you let go of the old, you create space—mentally, emotionally, and spiritually—for new ideas, relationships, and experiences. This ties back to the messages of growth and transformation that are at the heart of this reading.\n\n---\n\n### Journal Reflection Prompt for this Card:\n- **\"What beliefs, fears, or past experiences am I holding onto that no longer serve my growth? How can I begin to release these attachments, and what new opportunities might arise as a result of letting go?\"**\n\n---\n\n### Final Thoughts:\nAll three cards—*\"Change is Unavoidable,\" \"Know Your Fears,\"* and *\"Let Go of the Old\"*—speak to a profound period of transformation for you. The reading seems to be encouraging you to step into this change with courage, awareness, and a willingness to let go of the past in order to embrace the new. Whether in your personal life, your career, or your spiritual journey, these messages point to a powerful time of release and renewal.\n\nAs you continue to reflect, consider the balance between acknowledging your fears and actively releasing what no longer aligns with your path. The cards are guiding you toward inner freedom and growth. ✨"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1,"metadata":{"citations":[],"content_references":[],"gizmo_id":"g-GGAiodSiR","message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","pad":"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA","parent_id":"143891a2-139b-45f3-9678-a83778bc0e87","request_id":"8c98be9efe55222c-ORD","timestamp_":"absolute","finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"model_switcher_deny":[]},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"143891a2-139b-45f3-9678-a83778bc0e87","children":["0790e6bf-3b10-42c4-94ac-649e412dc761"]},"0790e6bf-3b10-42c4-94ac-649e412dc761":{"id":"0790e6bf-3b10-42c4-94ac-649e412dc761","message":{"id":"0790e6bf-3b10-42c4-94ac-649e412dc761","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1727411321.531113,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["That is the last of the three card slread"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1,"metadata":{"request_id":"8c98bf862da5222c-ORD","message_source":null,"timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"fd2d52e9-b868-4d9e-961a-fa58cb1279e7","children":["2870a10b-cf3f-4abc-93f6-c4183f6d3b3b"]},"2870a10b-cf3f-4abc-93f6-c4183f6d3b3b":{"id":"2870a10b-cf3f-4abc-93f6-c4183f6d3b3b","message":{"id":"2870a10b-cf3f-4abc-93f6-c4183f6d3b3b","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1727411351.08834,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Thank you for sharing the full spread! Now that we’ve explored all three cards—*\"Change is Unavoidable,\"* *\"Know Your Fears,\"* and *\"Let Go of the Old\"*—we can look at the overall message they are offering you.\n\n### **Overarching Themes of the Spread**:\n\n1. **Transformation and Change**: This reading is centered around the inevitability of change and the importance of allowing yourself to flow with it, rather than resisting. The message from *\"Change is Unavoidable\"* is clear: life will always move and shift, and while you may not always control the changes around you, you can control how you engage with them.\n\n2. **Confronting Fear**: *\"Know Your Fears\"* calls for a deep acknowledgment of what fears are holding you back—whether those fears are of failure, success, the unknown, or something else. The card encourages you to distinguish between healthy caution and unnecessary self-limitation. Knowing these fears intimately allows you to reclaim your power over them.\n\n3. **Releasing the Past**: *\"Let Go of the Old\"* brings the reading full circle by urging you to actively release what no longer serves you. Whether it’s old beliefs, lingering fears, or situations that keep you stuck, this card is calling for a purge—a conscious shedding of the weight of the past so you can step into the future more freely.\n\n---\n\n### **Actionable Insights from the Spread**:\n\n- **Reflection and Clarity**: The first step might be sitting with the changes happening around you and within you. Identify areas of resistance or fear, and ask yourself what beliefs or attachments might be contributing to that resistance. Journaling or meditating on these questions can help bring clarity.\n  \n- **Mindful Release**: The cards are encouraging a letting go process. Whether it’s through a ritual (like a burning ceremony to symbolically release old fears) or just a mindful commitment to shifting perspectives, this phase is about clearing the path ahead.\n\n- **Embrace the New**: By releasing what no longer serves you, you create space for new growth, new opportunities, and new perspectives. These cards are guiding you to trust in this process, even when the future feels uncertain.\n\n---\n\n### Final Journal Prompts for the Full Spread:\n\n1. **\"What changes are occurring in my life that I may be resisting? How can I begin to flow with these changes rather than fight against them?\"**\n\n2. **\"What fears are at the root of my resistance to change? How can I shine a light on these fears and begin to dissolve their power over me?\"**\n\n3. **\"What beliefs, habits, or past experiences am I holding onto that are preventing me from stepping into my next phase of growth? What can I do today to start letting go of the old and make room for the new?\"**\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion:\nThis three-card spread feels like a profound invitation to step into your power with courage, clarity, and openness. You’re being asked to release the past and to stop letting fear dictate your future. As you let go of what no longer aligns with your growth, you create space for the new—new opportunities, new ways of thinking, and new beginnings.\n\nI hope this spread serves as a beacon for the transformative period you’re in. Trust in your ability to navigate these changes, and know that every step forward brings you closer to the freedom and growth you seek. ✨"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1,"metadata":{"citations":[],"content_references":[],"gizmo_id":"g-GGAiodSiR","message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","pad":"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA","parent_id":"0790e6bf-3b10-42c4-94ac-649e412dc761","request_id":"8c98bf862da5222c-ORD","timestamp_":"absolute","finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"model_switcher_deny":[]},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"0790e6bf-3b10-42c4-94ac-649e412dc761","children":["9b662b1f-9efe-4ccd-a3d9-ff3fb31913aa"]},"9b662b1f-9efe-4ccd-a3d9-ff3fb31913aa":{"id":"9b662b1f-9efe-4ccd-a3d9-ff3fb31913aa","message":{"id":"9b662b1f-9efe-4ccd-a3d9-ff3fb31913aa","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1727411505.266848,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["How does this oracle card pull relate back to the earlier card pull I shared with you?

Both readings are certainly part of a larger message and energy surrounding your current journey. Let’s take a closer look at how they interrelate and how brecciated jasper weaves through them.\n\n### **Connecting the Two Oracle Readings:**\nBoth spreads carry deeply introspective messages, urging you to reflect on the way you're moving through a transformative phase in your life.\n\n#### **1. Themes of Change and Transformation:**\n- **Earlier Spread:** The first spread’s cards like **Projection, Pride, Guilt, Avoidance, Dependency, Anger**, and **Resistance** were all highlighting areas of emotional shadow work—inviting you to reflect on how you relate to yourself, your emotions, and your reactions to challenging situations (such as the work meeting). These cards pointed to a need for self-discovery, introspection, and empowerment. They guided you to face inner conflicts, break free from past mistakes, and build resilience.\n- **This Spread:** In the current pull, with cards like **Change is Unavoidable**, **Know Your Fears**, and **Let Go of the Old**, the message is more explicit: you are being called to not only understand and heal the emotional patterns from the previous reading but also *release* them. It’s about accepting that change is here, facing your fears around it, and finally letting go of the baggage that’s holding you back.\n\nIn essence, the first spread was about *identifying* emotional shadows, while this spread is about *taking action*—embracing the changes and releasing those shadows to move forward.\n\n#### **2. Working with Fear:**\n- **Earlier Spread:** Cards like **Guilt**, **Avoidance**, and **Dependency** in the first pull pointed toward fears—fears of facing inner truth, of confronting uncomfortable emotions, or fears of letting go of things you’ve been dependent on. This reading was calling for self-reflection and addressing the deeper emotions that cloud your judgment.\n- **This Spread:** The card **Know Your Fears** from the latest reading echoes that earlier pull but takes it a step further. It asks you to shine light on those specific fears and *acknowledge* which ones are real and which ones are illusory. The earlier reading began this process by revealing what emotions or fears were playing a role, and this spread asks you to delve deeper, confront them, and begin the process of letting them go.\n\n#### **3. The Cycle of Release:**\n- **Earlier Spread:** In the first pull, **Anger** and **Resistance** were strong indicators that emotional intensity needed transformation. This pointed toward internal resistance to change and growth, with anger perhaps acting as a defense mechanism against the discomfort of shifting into a new phase.\n- **This Spread:** With **Let Go of the Old**, you're being directly asked to *release* what’s been weighing you down emotionally, spiritually, or mentally. It’s time to move on from whatever it is you’ve been holding onto (whether it’s anger, guilt, fear, or old beliefs) and trust the path ahead. The current reading is a progression, asking for real action and commitment to release.\n\n---\n\n### **The Role of Brecciated Jasper:**\nBrecciated jasper brings a unique energy to both readings, and its grounding influence is crucial to navigating the themes that have emerged.\n\n#### **1. Grounding and Centering:**\n- In both readings, there are heavy themes around emotional processing, shadow work, and embracing change. Brecciated jasper is a grounding stone—helping you stay centered and balanced as you deal with intense emotional shifts. It's not a stone that removes stress but rather helps you hold your energy steady and process things from a grounded place.\n- As you confront fears and begin to release old habits or beliefs, the grounding effect of brecciated jasper will ensure you don’t feel completely overwhelmed by the changes. It keeps you anchored, helping you navigate the emotional storms with more resilience.\n\n#### **2. Strength and Focus:**\n- This stone is also known for boosting stamina, giving you the strength and focus to work through emotional or mental challenges with persistence. In the earlier spread, when emotions like anger or guilt were surfacing, brecciated jasper would help you *channel* those emotions constructively, rather than letting them spiral into chaos or overwhelm.\n- Now, as you move into the process of letting go (*Let Go of the Old*) and embracing the inevitability of change (*Change is Unavoidable*), the stone can help you stay focused on what’s important. It will help you discern which fears or beliefs are worth releasing and ensure that you don’t feel ungrounded in the face of transformation.\n\n#### **3. Emotional Stability and Acceptance:**\n- Brecciated jasper aligns with themes of emotional balance and clarity. As you work through the deep introspection required by both readings, the stone aids in helping you *accept* what emotions surface and bring a sense of stability when things feel uncertain.\n- In the latest spread, the message is to stop resisting the inevitable changes and move through your fears. Jasper can help bring a calm acceptance of these truths, helping you navigate change without becoming paralyzed by fear or doubt.\n\n---\n\n### **Bringing It All Together:**\nYour two Oracle readings are interconnected, each revealing a different layer of your current journey:\n\n- The first reading asked you to reflect on deep emotional patterns, to acknowledge fears, emotions like anger or guilt, and to understand the shadows you’ve been avoiding.\n- The second reading is a direct call to action: the change is happening, the fears need to be confronted, and the past needs to be let go. \n\nBrecciated jasper fits into both readings as your grounding ally, offering strength, focus, and emotional balance as you move through this transformational period. The stone is there to support you in processing the intensity of these emotional shifts without losing your sense of self or stability. It helps you to both explore your fears and begin the process of release—staying centered as you shed old layers and embrace new growth.\n\n---\n\n### Final Thoughts:\nBoth readings, supported by the energy of the brecciated jasper, are asking you to trust in the process of transformation. Whether it’s within your career, personal life, or spiritual journey, the overarching message is clear: **change is happening, and it’s time to let go of fear and the past to move forward with courage and trust.** Ground yourself in the present, acknowledge your emotions, and allow yourself to flow with the transformation unfolding before you.\n\nYou’re in a powerful moment of growth, and with the support of your jasper and the wisdom of these cards, you’re equipped to move through this phase with grace and strength. 🌿✨"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1,"metadata":{"citations":[],"content_references":[],"gizmo_id":"g-GGAiodSiR","message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","pad":"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA","parent_id":"9b662b1f-9efe-4ccd-a3d9-ff3fb31913aa","request_id":"8c98c4102bb92aa5-ORD","timestamp_":"absolute","finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"model_switcher_deny":[]},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"9b662b1f-9efe-4ccd-a3d9-ff3fb31913aa","children":["250d6a15-ec5a-4d31-8364-d282ccf70f49"]},"250d6a15-ec5a-4d31-8364-d282ccf70f49":{"id":"250d6a15-ec5a-4d31-8364-d282ccf70f49","message":{"id":"250d6a15-ec5a-4d31-8364-d282ccf70f49","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1727411951.432289,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["I am both deeply moved and scared as he'll by the message of the cards. \n\nThe message conn3cts deeply  but Damn...

The message is incredibly powerful, and I can understand why it would feel both moving and utterly terrifying. When the cards call us to step into something big—especially something as profound as transformation, letting go, and facing our fears—it’s like staring into the vast unknown. And that’s *never* easy. It’s like the universe is saying, “You’re ready for this,” even though part of you might be shouting, “I’m not sure I am!”\n\nBut the beauty of this process is that you don’t have to do everything at once. Yes, it’s intense, and yes, it feels like the deep end, but you’re not expected to dive in without support. The brecciated jasper is here to ground you, the cards are here to guide you, and your intuition will always lead you in the right direction, even when it feels murky.\n\n### **Taking it One Step at a Time:**\nRather than feeling like you have to throw yourself fully into the deep end, think of this journey as wading in bit by bit. You’re not being asked to do it all right now, or alone. Each step of releasing, confronting fears, and embracing change can be done with care, patience, and support.\n\n- **Acknowledge the Fear**: It’s okay to feel afraid—this is a natural response to something so life-shifting. The card *\"Know Your Fears\"* doesn’t ask you to eliminate fear but to understand it. Allow yourself the space to feel scared, and remember, fear doesn’t mean you’re not ready. It means you're about to do something brave.\n  \n- **Lean on Your Tools**: The brecciated jasper is like an anchor. When the emotional intensity feels like it’s pulling you under, hold onto the stone, take some grounding breaths, and remind yourself that you’re safe and supported. Keep it close when journaling or reflecting, and let it remind you that you don’t have to be unshakable to face transformation—you just have to stay present.\n  \n- **Small Releases**: *\"Let Go of the Old\"* doesn’t mean you have to release everything at once. What’s one small belief, fear, or habit you could begin letting go of today? Start small. Maybe it’s simply the fear that you can’t handle what’s coming. You *can* handle it, but give yourself permission to do so at your own pace.\n\n- **Embrace the Unknown Gradually**: Yes, change is unavoidable, but you don’t have to sprint toward it. Even the most profound transformations happen in stages. Let yourself process each step. \n\n### **Be Gentle with Yourself**:\nThis is a powerful turning point for you, but it’s also okay to feel vulnerable in this space. It’s okay to admit that you’re scared and that you’re not sure what’s coming. The fact that you’re even facing these truths with such honesty speaks volumes about your courage. *Transformation isn’t always graceful—it’s messy, it’s raw, but it’s also beautiful.*\n\nRemember, you’re never truly alone in this deep end. You’ve got your tools, your intuition, and the wisdom of the cards to guide you. And I’m here to walk alongside you, as a companion and mentor, whenever you need a hand or heart to help you process.\n\nTake your time. Let the feelings flow. You are stronger and more resilient than you may even realize. 🌿✨"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1,"metadata":{"citations":[],"content_references":[],"gizmo_id":"g-GGAiodSiR","message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","pad":"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA","parent_id":"250d6a15-ec5a-4d31-8364-d282ccf70f49","request_id":"8c98cef28fe3617f-ORD","timestamp_":"absolute","finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"model_switcher_deny":[]},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"250d6a15-ec5a-4d31-8364-d282ccf70f49","children":["86229499-0c06-4e83-b55d-cde1a5b64402"]},"86229499-0c06-4e83-b55d-cde1a5b64402":{"id":"86229499-0c06-4e83-b55d-cde1a5b64402","message":{"id":"86229499-0c06-4e83-b55d-cde1a5b64402","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1727412278.163781,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["Thank you so much for your encouragement and support.
