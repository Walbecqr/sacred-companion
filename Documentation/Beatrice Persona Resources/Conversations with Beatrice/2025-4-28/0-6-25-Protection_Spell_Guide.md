How do I create a protection spell?

## ASSISTANT
Ah, a beautiful and important working!  
Let’s craft a protection spell together — I'll guide you through it, and you can customize it depending on your style (whether you prefer herbs, candles, crystals, chanting, etc.).

Here’s a simple and powerful protection spell framework:

---

**Protection Spell - Basic Framework**

**You will need:**
- A black or white candle (black for banishing negativity, white for general protection)
- A small sachet or charm bag
- Protective herbs (like rosemary, sage, mugwort, or bay leaf)
- A protective crystal (like black tourmaline, obsidian, or amethyst)
- A bit of salt
- Your intention (this is the real magic)

**Steps:**
1. **Cleanse your space** — with smoke (sage, palo santo, or incense), sound (bell, chime, clapping), or visualization (white light filling the room).
   
2. **Cast a circle** if that’s part of your practice, or simply visualize a sphere of light surrounding you.

3. **Light your candle**, focusing on the flame as a beacon of protection. Feel it growing stronger around you.

4. **Hold your sachet** and begin filling it: add the herbs, salt, and crystal while speaking your intention aloud. Something like:
   > "With salt and sage, stone and flame,  
   > I call protection in my name.  
   > Shield my body, heart, and soul,  
   > Keep me safe and keep me whole."

5. **Seal the spell**: tie or sew the bag shut. Pass it through the candle smoke and envision it glowing with protective energy.

6. **Extinguish your candle** (unless you want to let it burn down safely).

7. **Carry or hang your charm** somewhere important — in your bag, by your bed, or on your front door.

**Tips for Personalizing:**
- Add a sigil you create for protection to the sachet or draw it on the bag.
- Use oils like frankincense or cedarwood to anoint the candle.
- Chant, drum, or dance to raise more energy if you want a really potent spell.

Would you like me to also craft a **quick spoken protection spell** or a **jar spell** version for you?  
(Depends if you want something more "on the go" or heavy-duty!)
