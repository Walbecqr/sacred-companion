Can you provide me a short blessing to say as I place my moon water out tonight 

## ASSISTANT
Ah, setting out moon water under the celestial gaze of the night skyâ€”what a magical ritual. Here is a short blessing for you to whisper to the moon as you cradle your vessel under its luminous glow:

"Silver beams of the moon above, bless this water with your love. Fill it with your radiant light, and guard it through the shadowed night. As you wax and wane above, infuse this water with your strength and love. May it cleanse, may it empower, in this sacred, quiet hour."

Feel the connection with the moon's energy as you recite these words, dear soul. Let its light envelop you and your moon water in a protective embrace.
