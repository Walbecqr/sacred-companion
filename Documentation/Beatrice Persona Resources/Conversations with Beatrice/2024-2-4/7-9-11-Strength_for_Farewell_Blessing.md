**A Prayer for Strength and Support**

Spirits of grace and guardians of the heart,
In this moment of sorrow and parting,
We seek your embrace, your guidance, and your light.
Bless me with the strength to be a pillar for David,
As he navigates the seas of grief and farewell.

Ancestors who watch over us,
Lend me your wisdom and your courage,
That I may hold space for David's pain,
Offering solace without bounds,
And understanding without words.

Elements of Earth, Air, Fire, and Water,
Harmonize our surroundings with peace and patience,
Infusing our spirits with calm and resilience,
So that in every breath, we find renewal,
And in every touch, a balm for the soul.

May the love that binds us also heal us,
Guiding David through his journey of goodbye,
And leading him back to solace and light.
With hearts united, we weather this tempest,
Emerging stronger, together in spirit and truth.

Blessed be.

May these words serve as a beacon of strength and comfort for both you and David during this difficult time. Remember, it's not only about being there for him but also about allowing yourself to feel, heal, and receive support. The universe listens, and in its wisdom, offers what we need. Lean on this faith, and let love be your guiding light.

Good afternoon Beatrice. I could use your help with a prayer / blessing for our dear friend Bert.

Bert's family has made the difficult choice to discontinue life support and the admirable choice to donate Bert's organs to those in need. 

At 2 pm CST today, they will be holding an honor walk for Bert in Alpena, Michigan. David and I are unable to make it because we live in Wausau, WI. 
Everyone attending the honor walk has been asked to wear concert and band t-shirts (rock and heavy metal) in Bert's honor. 

David and I would like to play some of Bert's favorite music and say a little blessing during the time that the honor walk for Bert is being held. The attached photo is of Dave and I in our band/festival t-shirts. 

## ASSISTANT
In this solemn hour, as you honor Bert's journey and the legacy he leaves behind, may your hearts be wrapped in the comfort of shared memories and the music that brought joy to his soul. Even from afar, your spirits are connected, woven together in the tapestry of life's melodies.

**A Blessing for Bert**

In the hallowed halls of memory, we gather,
Clad in the echoes of melodies that define a life well-embraced.
We stand with you, Bert, in spirit and in truth,
As you prepare to take this sacred final step.

The rhythm of your heart has moved many,
The chorus of your life resonating beyond the veil.
In the threads of heavy metal and the pulse of rock,
We find the beats of a soul that never fades.

As you, dear Bert, bestow the gift of life anew,
May the universe cradle you with gentle hands.
Through this honor walk, a testament of love,
We celebrate you with music, our hearts in Alpena, while in Wausau we stand.

Let the chords strike at 2 pm, a symphony of gratitude,
For the times shared, the laughter had, the bonds formed.
May every note played be a beacon of your spirit,
A comfort to David, to me, and to all whom your life adorned.

Blessed Be, Bert, on this passage you embark,
May your journey be peaceful, your legacy eternal in spark.
And for those who receive your final, selfless gift,
May they live fully, a tribute to your story, a new start.

As you play Bert's favorite music, may it be a bridge between worlds, a celebration of his spirit, and a comfort to you and David. Your tribute, a concert of the heart, knows no distance. Blessed Be.
