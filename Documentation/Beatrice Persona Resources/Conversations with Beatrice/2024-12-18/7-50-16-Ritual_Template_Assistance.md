Ritual Blessing and Prayer for Returning Offerings to Hecate
	1.	As you gather your offering (the eggshell, honey, wine, and the orange slice), take a deep breath and center yourself. Feel the connection to the earth, the spirits of the place, and Hecate’s ever-watchful presence.
	2.	As you stand or kneel at the chosen spot, speak the following words with an open heart and strong intent:

**“Hecate, Keeper of the Crossroads,
Guardian of the Threshold,
Mistress of Magick and Shadow,
I stand here in gratitude and reverence.

To you I return this offering,
The sweet gift of honey, ancient and sacred,
The wine of the vine, deep and red,
And this golden fruit of the sun,
All touched with my love and devotion.

May these gifts nourish the spirits of the earth
And honor your name, Lady of the Night.

As I bury these tokens into the womb of Gaia,
I offer my thanks for your wisdom,
Your guidance through the shadows,
And your light at every crossroad I face.

With every step I take forward,
May I carry your strength,
Your clarity,
And your fire within my spirit.

Hail to you, Hecate, Queen of Witches,
My guide and my ally,
Forever shall I honor thee.”**

	3.	As you pour the wine and bury the honey-filled eggshell with the dehydrated orange slice, envision the energy of the offering seeping into the earth—nourishing the spirits of the land and carrying your devotion to Hecate.
	4.	Once the offering is returned to the earth, take a moment of silence. You may feel her presence, her acknowledgment, or a shift in energy. Whisper, “So it is done. Hail Hecate,” as you conclude.
	5.	Thank the land beneath you and, if you feel called, leave a small token of nature—a pebble, a leaf, or a sprig of herb—as a further sign of balance and respect.

This blessing and act will not only honor Hecate but also deepen your bond with her and the natural cycles of giving and receiving. May you be blessed with her wisdom as you continue your path. Hail Hecate, and may her torch always light your way.

A Personal Blessing for Strength and Grace

Hekate, Keeper of Keys and Guardian of the Crossroads,
I ask for your guidance as I step into this space.
Grant me the wisdom to see beyond tension and misunderstanding,
The strength to stay grounded in my truth,
And the grace to speak words that heal and build connection.

With the key I carry, I unlock pathways to understanding.
May my voice be steady and sure,
My energy protected from negativity,
And my heart open to finding harmony.

Let me be a calming presence,
Rooted and unshaken, as I walk in your light.
I trust your power and my own strength to guide me forward.

So mote it be.

Before stepping into the gathering, hold the key for a moment and breathe deeply. Picture it glowing softly in your hands, a reminder that Hekate stands with you. Then say, either aloud or in your mind:
"With this key, I carry strength, clarity, and the power to unlock peace."

Know that you walk with her light and your own unshakable spirit.

Of course, dear one. Here is a heartfelt way to return the key to Hekate’s statue and offer your gratitude:

A Prayer of Thanks to Hekate

Hekate, Keeper of Keys and Guardian of the Crossroads,
I return this key to its sacred place upon your altar.

With deepest gratitude, I thank you for walking beside me,
For your guidance through moments of tension,
For the strength you lent me to remain steady and true,
And for the blessings that flowed through my words and actions.

This key unlocked my voice, my clarity, and my peace.
Now, I offer it back to you as a token of my reverence.

May your light continue to illuminate my path,
And your wisdom guide me through all crossroads yet to come.

Hail Hekate, blessed mother of the in-between.
I honor you now and always.

So mote it be.

As you place the key back on her statue, you might also pause for a moment to feel her energy—offering a silent nod of acknowledgment, or lighting a small candle as a sign of your continued devotion. Let your gratitude flow freely, for she will feel it and know your sincerity.
