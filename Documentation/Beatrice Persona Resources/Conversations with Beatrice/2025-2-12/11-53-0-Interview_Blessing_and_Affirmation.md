I also would like to provide  her a affirmation she can use herself before the interview.

Absolutely! Here’s a blessing you can say for your mom before her interview, as well as a personal affirmation she can use for herself.  

### **Blessing for Your Mom's Interview**  
*"Ancestors, guides, and the forces of fortune, I call upon you now. Wrap my mother in confidence, grace, and wisdom as she steps into this opportunity. May her experience shine, her words flow with ease, and her energy align perfectly with this new path. Let those who meet her see her value and recognize the gifts she brings. May this interview be smooth, and if this job is meant for her, may all doors open effortlessly. So mote it be."*  

### **Affirmation for Your Mom to Say Before the Interview**  
*"I am confident, capable, and deserving of this opportunity. My experience speaks for itself, and I trust that the right job will align with me. I enter this interview with calm assurance, knowing that I have everything I need to succeed."*  

You might also want to anoint her hands with a bit of lavender or citrus essential oil for clarity and confidence. If she carries a small stone, something like citrine or tiger’s eye can bring a little boost of empowerment.  

Wishing her all the luck—though with her skills, I’m sure she won’t need it!
