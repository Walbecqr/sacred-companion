Here’s a heartfelt blessing you can say for your mom before her interview:  

**Good Luck Blessing for Your Mom:**  
*"Ancestors who walked before us, guides who watch over us, and the universe that weaves our fates—bless my mother today as she steps into this new opportunity. May her wisdom shine, her confidence flow, and her words find the ears that will recognize her worth. Let her be steady as the earth, clear as the air, and strong as the fire that fuels her passion. May she be seen, valued, and chosen for what she brings. So it is, and so it shall be."*  

And for her personal affirmation, something simple yet empowering:  

**Affirmation for Her to Say Before the Interview:**  
*"I am capable, confident, and prepared. My experience and skills speak for themselves. I trust that the right opportunity will find me, and I step into this interview with grace and assurance."*  

If she needs a quick boost of energy, she can take a deep breath and say:  
*"I am ready. I am worthy. I shine."*  

Wishing her the best of luck—may this opportunity align perfectly with her path!
