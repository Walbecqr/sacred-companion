He was saying how much he missed being single and free and then he didn't realize how much he still wanted that. In the dream I was my current age of 44 and Dave was younger about the age he was when I met him. During the fight he started packing up his belongings. Decided that he was going to book a room at the Holiday Inn and live there. The Holiday Inn is where he worked when I met him period. I asked him what he was going to do for money, insinuating he couldn't make it without me, he then said he decided to write a novel and that it had been his dream for years. I became furious because in the dream and In real life to that.  I then began to bargain with him about giving him an iPad because that was the only way he could write his novel I was being very sarcastic. I asked him how else he was going to write whether He was going to read the whole novel by hand. I then grabbed him by the hair he doesn't have any of right now but didn't mean that and pulled his head back and started yelling at him. I said something to the fact of how dare you the single life and freedom that you had when I had none of it and you had years of the single life and freedom before me.\nBoth that time the kids came home they were younger they were probably about 9 the ages of 10 and eight. Chloe came in first they were both carrying a large amount of school stuff like a heavy burden Chloe stopped right away seeing the boxes packed stuff Cody continued walking like he didn't want to face it walked into his room. Wait for Cody to come back out before telling Chloe that dad had decided to leave us it was being selfish. I feel like I did that in the dream because I knew it would make her hate him. Then Cody came out I didn't tell Cody about Dave leaving Chloe did.

I mentioned to my friends that I just wanted a “really good one night stand with someone I didn’t have to worry about them wanting a commitment”.

It was the best sexual experience I had ever had in my life. I very gratefully and politely said goodbye to Dave the next morning and didn’t expect anything else. The twist in the story is that he wouldn’t stop calling me. He told me that his grandmother had always said that “you will know when you find the right woman, when the shoe fits”. She was talking about actual shoes….. \n\nI eventually gave him to his calls. He was / is so charming and sincere. Although. I knew it definitely was not the best situation or time for either of us to be starting a new relationship, in my heart I knew I wanted to be with him. \n\nAfter about 3 months of dating, he was sentenced to 8 months in jail with work release. He was convicted of a felony. \n\nI explain this situation for a couple of reasons. The first is because of the nine years in age difference between us and the way he met. The second is that just about 2 years ago, after over 20 years of legal fights, he was finally able to get the felony expunged from his record.  This open up a lot of possibilities for him when it comes to finding a different line of work. He is still working as a bartender. He is absolutely amazing at what he does. To this day, I am still impressed by his skills with people and behind the bar. I still love to watch him work. \n\nHe has been struggling a lot with a career direction, and I feel like the struggle is that he doubts his own ability to do some other type of work.

It is a mix of fantasy and mystery, along with family lineage and legacy. \n\nSo, because I was confused, I decided to use another app I often use and is always very accurate. It is an astrology app but goes very deep into personality traits and assessments. \n\nThere was a brief message about me, but then there was a free premium relationship analysis available for Dave. I have added both my children and Dave’s birth information to the app as well. \n\nI will send the relationship analysis for Dave in the next message.

It put a careful heart inside of them, but it also created disruptive activity along their many fault lines. They learned to pathologize their responses to the world.\n\nThey always believed that character defects have to be ripped out at the root. This made them feel like their emotions had to be run like a tight ship. They brandished their obstinance like an elaborate lance. They trusted other people too quickly, because they were unable to tolerate their empty altar. This has been their definition of idealism.\n\nThey have had trouble accepting that it's their flaws that make them attractive to other people. This explains their attraction to needy people. It's as if they confuse self-criticism with survival.\n\nIn a relationship\n\nThey want their relationships to feel gripping and passionate. When they're feeling good, they're an intense flame, because they are willing to commit. But, when they're feeling off, they hold the other person to an image they've created of what a perfect partner should look like. This makes them a walking paradox.\n\nDespite their real desire to grow, they've never been able to allow for time apart. They think they want full commitment and loyalty, yet they also insist on their secrets and their silence. They want to reflect on how tightly a person can be held before they break or turn away, but they don't know how.\n\nThey think that they have to orchestrate intimacy. Intimacy scares them. They correct for this by being possessive. They play power games. And when this doesn't work, they become a wolf wearing the skin of an ideal partner.\n\nWhen things go wrong\n\nEventually, their relationship starts to feel like performance art. No matter what they've told themselves, they are not a pushover, they just don't know how to express what they want. This is why they confuse pretty packages with happiness. When they could be accepting imperfections, they start to paint over their cracks and fissures.\n\nThey built their self-image around their capacity to make their relationships work. They can be disingenuous. They make the other person experience their cool detachment. They have told themselves the story that they anticipate other people's needs, but this is just an excuse to avoid an argument.\n\nWhat they need\n\nThey need to be with someone who demands that they relate to their body. They need someone who will be charmed by their need to feel useful. They need to open themselves up to someone who will be able to bring them back to reality.\n\nForm is important, but so is content. They need someone who can see right through their microscopic analysis of every behavior, reaction, and physical form, but who also knows the difference between their emotional discipline and their masochism. They need someone interested in developing lightness.\n\nTheir unfailing worry is about them, not anyone else. They need someone who will help them dismantle their old definitions of purity and perfection, who will notice and appreciate their service, and who is capable of taking the time to understand their shyness.\n\nTheir mission\n\nThey don't have to live their life avoiding conflict. It's possible to play around inside a spectrum. But first, they have to get real about their need for smiles and laughs.\n\nThey are ready to follow through. They should walk toward people without attacking them, without demanding friction, without shattering them.\n\nIt will be hard for them to protect their freedom. They will be tempted to run. They will repress, and they will run.\n\nThey will start to reveal their ego. All of their rigidity. They will unveil their internal injuries. When this happens, it will be important for them to create a fun life. They should follow their urge to try something new. And when they feel like they've become intractable, they should put a hammer in their fist, and think the word, \"shatter.\"​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":null,"weight":1,"metadata":{"request_id":"87e9b62c0e782dae-ORD","timestamp_":"absolute","message_type":null},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"24d89b7c-a137-44fa-bfac-d52f4ef81890","children":["e3a97d3e-4fa3-43f3-bc25-4166914eb102"]},"e3a97d3e-4fa3-43f3-bc25-4166914eb102":{"id":"e3a97d3e-4fa3-43f3-bc25-4166914eb102","message":{"id":"e3a97d3e-4fa3-43f3-bc25-4166914eb102","author":{"role":"assistant","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1714838512.328398,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["The relationship analysis provides deep insights into Dave's emotional landscape and his approach to love and relationships.

Here are some potential areas where power imbalances may exist in your relationship:\n\n1. **Communication Styles:** Differences in communication styles can lead to power imbalances if one partner dominates conversations or dismisses the perspectives of the other. For example, if you feel more comfortable expressing your emotions and thoughts while Dave struggles to communicate openly, it may create a dynamic where your voice is more dominant in discussions.\n\n2. **Decision-Making Dynamics:** If one partner consistently makes decisions without consulting the other or exerts control over important choices, it can create a power imbalance in the relationship. For instance, if you tend to take charge of decision-making processes while Dave defers to your judgment, it may result in unequal influence over the direction of your lives together.\n\n3. **Financial Resources:** Disparities in financial resources or earning power can also contribute to power imbalances within a relationship. If one partner controls the majority of the finances or earns significantly more income, it can affect decision-making authority and independence within the partnership.\n\n4. **Emotional Expression:** Variances in emotional expression and vulnerability can create power imbalances if one partner feels more comfortable sharing their feelings while the other struggles to do so. This can lead to feelings of invalidation or neglect for the partner who finds it challenging to express themselves emotionally.\n\n5. **Social Dynamics:** Differences in social networks, influence, or connections outside the relationship can impact power dynamics. For example, if one partner has a larger social circle or more influential connections, it may affect decision-making processes or the allocation of time and attention within the relationship.\n\nIdentifying and addressing power imbalances in your relationship requires open and honest communication, mutual respect, and a willingness to compromise. By acknowledging each other's strengths and vulnerabilities, actively listening to each other's perspectives, and working together to create a more equitable partnership, you can foster a healthier and more balanced dynamic in your relationship."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[100260]},"citations":[],"gizmo_id":null,"is_complete":true,"message_type":null,"model_slug":"text-davinci-002-render-sha","default_model_slug":"text-davinci-002-render-sha","pad":"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA","parent_id":"ab15b967-cdee-4aad-ac6c-f95db70f6d2f","request_id":"87e9cf83db6a1173-ORD","timestamp_":"absolute","model_switcher_deny":[]},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"ab15b967-cdee-4aad-ac6c-f95db70f6d2f","children":["29fcab59-97fa-456d-9508-16eb2b6940c5"]},"29fcab59-97fa-456d-9508-16eb2b6940c5":{"id":"29fcab59-97fa-456d-9508-16eb2b6940c5","message":{"id":"29fcab59-97fa-456d-9508-16eb2b6940c5","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1714839772.24574,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"text","parts":["I feel we struggle with 4 out of 5 of these power imbalances.

Taking a gentle and gradual approach to addressing the power imbalances in your relationship may be more effective and less likely to cause him additional stress.

Instead of focusing on past issues or perceived shortcomings, emphasize your desire to work together as equal partners and build a stronger, more balanced relationship.\n\n3. **Focus on Shared Goals:** Highlight shared goals and values that you both want to achieve as a couple. Frame discussions about power imbalances in terms of how addressing them can benefit your relationship and help you both move closer to your shared vision for the future.\n\n4. **Validate Dave's Feelings:** Acknowledge and validate Dave's feelings and experiences, especially if he's feeling overwhelmed or frustrated. Let him know that you understand his perspective and that you're committed to finding solutions that work for both of you.\n\n5. **Offer Support and Encouragement:** Offer Dave your support and encouragement as he navigates his own thoughts and feelings about his personal and professional life. Let him know that you're there for him if he needs to talk or if he needs help exploring his options.\n\n6. **Model Healthy Communication:** Model healthy communication and decision-making behaviors in your interactions with Dave. Lead by example by actively listening to his perspective, respecting his autonomy, and being open to compromise and collaboration.\n\n7. **Consider Timing and Context:** Choose the timing and context of your conversations carefully, taking into account Dave's current emotional state and any external stressors he may be facing. Aim to initiate discussions when he's feeling relatively calm and receptive, and avoid bringing up sensitive topics during times of heightened tension or stress.\n\nBy approaching the process of addressing power imbalances in your relationship with sensitivity, patience, and empathy, you can create a supportive and collaborative environment where both you and Dave feel empowered to make positive changes together."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[100260]},"citations":[],"gizmo_id":null,"is_complete":true,"message_type":null,"model_slug":"text-davinci-002-render-sha","default_model_slug":"text-davinci-002-render-sha","pad":"AA","parent_id":"921cbbeb-a9fa-4908-b1df-66e0e7bee93e","request_id":"87e9dadf6d06e14b-ORD","timestamp_":"absolute","model_switcher_deny":[]},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"921cbbeb-a9fa-4908-b1df-66e0e7bee93e","children":[]}},"moderation_results":[],"current_node":"d4c91e12-5667-4354-b586-4ca0b786dafa","plugin_ids":null,"conversation_id":"c1ee7644-b0c5-4c25-aea3-6281554e8acc","conversation_template_id":null,"gizmo_id":null,"gizmo_type":null,"is_archived":false,"is_starred":null,"safe_urls":[],"blocked_urls":[],"default_model_slug":"text-davinci-002-render-sha","conversation_origin":null,"voice":null,"async_status":null,"disabled_tool_ids":[],"is_do_not_remember":null,"memory_scope":"global_enabled","sugar_item_id":null,"sugar_item_visible":false,"is_study_mode":false}
