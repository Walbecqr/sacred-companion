Good afternoon Beatrice. Merry Meet!

I could use some assistnace creating a prayer that I can say for my daughter Chloe

She is struggling right now. She is in a relationship that has made her the happiest i have ever seen her. However, her boyfriend is struggling with his own insecurities and this is causing tension in the relationship. In addition, she just move into a new apartment and nothing seems to be going smooth. Things like appliances not being installed, water not hooked up, challenges with getting her internet connected. 

She is feeling very overwhelmed right now. 

## ASSISTANT

**Prayer for Chloe’s Peace and Strength**

Divine Spirits and Loving Ancestors,  
I call upon your gentle guidance and protection,  
Surround my daughter, Chloe, in your nurturing light.  
Grant her the courage to navigate the waves of uncertainty,  
And the wisdom to find calm within the storm.

May her heart be soothed by the love she shares,  
May her boyfriend find peace within himself,  
So that their relationship may blossom with understanding and trust.  
Let their bond grow strong, built on a foundation of love and respect,  
And may they both be guided by compassion for one another.

In her new home, may obstacles turn into opportunities,  
May the path clear for all that she needs,  
And may the space be filled with warmth, security, and harmony.  
Bless her with patience as she settles into this new chapter,  
And let her know she is never alone,  
For she is held in the embrace of love and light.

As above, so below,  
As within, so without,  
So mote it be.

Feel free to speak these words aloud, or hold them in your heart as you send love and protection to Chloe. Remember, your energy and intention will travel to her, bringing her comfort in these trying times.
