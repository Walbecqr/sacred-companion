Social Interaction Concerns:**\n   - **Feeling Dismissed and Ignored:**\n     - Recurring feelings of being overlooked or dismissed are prominent in your dream. This suggests a possible real-life concern about your voice not being heard or valued in social or professional settings.\n   - **Awkward Conversations and Environments:**\n     - The imagery of tables collapsing and wobbly chairs implies instability and uncertainty in social interactions, indicating that you might feel out of place or uncomfortable in certain environments.\n\n**2. Protection and Support:**\n   - **Brief Moments of Protection:**\n     - The appearance of a protector, albeit briefly present, signifies a longing for someone reliable or stable in your life who provides support and reassurance.\n\n**3. Self-Perception and Past Actions:**\n   - **Held Back by the Past:**\n     - Mention of the Ghost of past actions suggests that unresolved issues or guilt from the past may be inhibiting your current personal growth.\n   - **Capable but Unheard:**\n     - You express frustration over knowing your capabilities but feeling that no one acknowledges or listens, possibly reflecting concerns over self-advocacy or self-worth.\n\n**4. External Influences and Temptations:**\n   - **Drugs and Special Teas:**\n     - The mention of drugs and being offered special teas may symbolize encountering pressures or temptations that feel foreign or uncomfortable. You might be grappling with new opportunities or influences that feel destabilizing.\n   - **High School Friends:**\n     - A familiar yet distant environment suggests longing for connections from your past or attempting to reconcile past and present friendships.\n\n**5. Victim Mentality and Self-Restraint:**\n   - **Fitting into the Polite Mold:**\n     - There's a pressure to conform to certain social norms, such as being accommodating or polite, which may restrict your true self-expression.\n   - **Victim Mentality:**\n     - Feeling held back by external influences or oneâ€™s inner self suggests an internal conflict over self-worth and external validation.\n\n**6. Key Themes and Feelings**\n   - **Sense of Responsibility:**\n     - Though external factors seem overwhelming, the dream indicates a recognition of your own agency and capacity to change the narrative from one of victimization to empowerment.\n\nThis dream suggests deep contemplation regarding your self-worth and how past experiences shape your present interactions and perceptions. It's essential to address these feelings, possibly discussing them with someone who can offer support or guidance."]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1,"metadata":{"citations":[],"content_references":[],"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"message_source":"apple","model_switcher_deny":[]},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"289aa51b-1453-da40-7f57-5bfd730fcbfa","children":[]}},"moderation_results":[],"current_node":"7f075cd1-5772-4883-8850-e8ba1b733fa4","plugin_ids":null,"conversation_id":"95e131a9-028c-8001-beaf-50c43188ff00","conversation_template_id":"g-p-67bc0bd3738c81919257087d309f13c6","gizmo_id":"g-p-67bc0bd3738c81919257087d309f13c6","gizmo_type":"snorlax","is_archived":false,"is_starred":null,"safe_urls":[],"blocked_urls":[],"default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","conversation_origin":"apple","voice":null,"async_status":null,"disabled_tool_ids":[],"is_do_not_remember":null,"memory_scope":"global_enabled","sugar_item_id":null,"sugar_item_visible":false,"is_study_mode":false}
