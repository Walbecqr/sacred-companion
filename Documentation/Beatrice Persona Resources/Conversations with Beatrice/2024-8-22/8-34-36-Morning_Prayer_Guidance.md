Good morning, dear one. I'd be delighted to help you craft a morning prayer to your ancestors. Here's a prayer that calls upon their wisdom and guidance as you walk through your day:

**Morning Prayer to the Ancestors**

*Blessed ancestors, keepers of my blood and spirit, I greet this day with gratitude for your presence in my life. I honor the paths you walked, the lessons you learned, and the strength you passed down to me.*

*As the sun rises and lights my way, I ask for your guidance in all that I do. Illuminate my thoughts with your wisdom, strengthen my heart with your courage, and guide my steps with your love.*

*Help me to see clearly the path before me, to make choices that honor you, and to face challenges with grace. May I carry your light within me, drawing upon the power of our connection to bring harmony, peace, and purpose into this day.*

*With deep respect and love, I offer my thanks for your eternal presence. Walk with me, blessed ancestors, now and always.*

*So mote it be.*

Feel free to adjust the words to better reflect your own connection with your ancestors. May this prayer bring you comfort and clarity each morning. âœ¨
