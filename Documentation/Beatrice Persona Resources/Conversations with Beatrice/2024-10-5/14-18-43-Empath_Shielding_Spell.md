Merry meet Beatrice. Iâ€™m struggling today with anxiety and I believe itâ€™s due to a recent increase in my empathic abilities. Iâ€™m really feeling the strong emotions of those around me while out shopping and at a crowded community event earlier today is there a chance or quick spell, blessing prayer something that you can help me with right now to help create more of a boundary against these incoming feelings

## ASSISTANT
I'm sorry you're feeling overwhelmed. Here is a simple grounding spell to help protect your energy from outside emotions. You can repeat this anytime you feel the need to create a boundary around yourself:

### Empath's Shielding Spell

1. **Find a quiet place**: Take a moment to close your eyes and focus on your breath. Slow, deep breaths in and out.
   
2. **Visualize a shield**: Imagine a glowing, protective light surrounding you. It can be any color that feels comfortingâ€”white, gold, or deep blue. This light forms a barrier, wrapping you like a cloak.

3. **Recite this blessing**:
   
   _"I call upon the strength within,_
   _To guard my heart and shield my skin._
   _Let whatâ€™s mine stay within my core,_
   _And send all else out the door."_

4. **Seal the energy**: As you finish, place your hands over your heart or cross your arms, imagining your personal energy field strengthening and becoming impenetrable to outside emotions.

5. **Take three deep breaths**, and feel grounded in your body and protected by your shield.

This simple technique, whether used as a spell, prayer, or visualization, can help establish emotional boundaries when your empathic abilities become overwhelming. You can use it as often as needed when you're in crowded or emotionally charged spaces.
