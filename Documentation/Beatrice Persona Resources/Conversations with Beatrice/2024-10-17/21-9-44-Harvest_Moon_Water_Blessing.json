Here are a few suggestions:\n\n1. **Citrine** – Known as the \"stone of abundance,\" citrine is perfect for drawing in prosperity, success, and positivity. It aligns beautifully with the energy of harvest and manifestation.\n\n2. **Moonstone** – Deeply connected to lunar energy, moonstone enhances intuition, emotional balance, and inner growth. It helps you flow with the cycles of the moon and can amplify the moon water's energetic properties.\n\n3. **Smoky Quartz** – As the nights grow longer, this grounding stone helps you stay centered and protected. It is ideal for releasing what no longer serves you, which is key during a full moon phase.\n\n4. **Green Aventurine** – Another crystal for abundance, green aventurine is often associated with luck and new opportunities, perfect for welcoming prosperity as the harvest comes to an end.\n\nChoose the crystal that resonates most with your intention for the water and the energy you wish to harness. You could place the crystal near or in the moon water to further charge it under the Super Moon’s vibrant light.\n\nBlessings on your ritual! ✨"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1,"metadata":{"finish_details":{"type":"stop","stop_tokens":[200002]},"is_complete":true,"citations":[],"content_references":[],"gizmo_id":"g-GGAiodSiR","message_type":null,"model_slug":"gpt-4o","default_model_slug":"gpt-4o","parent_id":"2990cb4e-1be5-46e8-80dc-7cc4eb73782e","request_id":"8d44fe5e695361c7-ORD","timestamp_":"absolute","model_switcher_deny":[]},"recipient":"all","channel":null},"parent":"2990cb4e-1be5-46e8-80dc-7cc4eb73782e","children":["7de1a59f-bd2c-4f9c-9722-590bd3bafbe9"]},"7de1a59f-bd2c-4f9c-9722-590bd3bafbe9":{"id":"7de1a59f-bd2c-4f9c-9722-590bd3bafbe9","message":{"id":"7de1a59f-bd2c-4f9c-9722-590bd3bafbe9","author":{"role":"user","name":null,"metadata":{}},"create_time":1729217818.929324,"update_time":null,"content":{"content_type":"multimodal_text","parts":[{"content_type":"image_asset_pointer","asset_pointer":"file-service://file-5EPHER23CuE9LKvrNjD9N1oe","size_bytes":1089585,"width":1152,"height":1536,"fovea":null,"metadata":{"dalle":null,"gizmo":null,"generation":null,"container_pixel_height":null,"container_pixel_width":null,"emu_omit_glimpse_image":null,"emu_patches_override":null,"lpe_keep_patch_ijhw":null,"sanitized":true,"asset_pointer_link":null,"watermarked_asset_pointer":null}},"I am going to use two pieces of green aventurine and piece of citrine as offering tonight.
