**Harvest Super Moon Blessing for October 17, 2024**

*You will need:*  
- Your container of water, preferably in a clear glass vessel  
- A small offering to the Earth, like a flower, herb, or crystal  
- A candle (optional) for focus, preferably white or silver

**Instructions:**  
1. Stand beneath the moonlight, holding your vessel of water in both hands. Ground yourself by taking three deep breaths, feeling the energy from the Earth rise through your feet, anchoring you to the present.
2. Place the offering on the ground as a symbol of gratitude for the Earth's bounty.
3. Raise the vessel of water toward the moon, letting the silver rays bless it.

**Recite:**

*"By the power of this Harvest Moon so bright,*  
*I call upon the energy of this sacred night.*  
*Abundance flows in, like the tide and the sea,*  
*As I give thanks, prosperity comes to me.*  
*Luna, great mother, in your light I stand,*  
*Bless this water by your gentle hand.*  
*For protection, for healing, for wisdom, for peace,*  
*May its power grow as the moonâ€™s light does increase.*  
*From this night forward, my path will align,*  
*With the cycles of the Earth and the stars that shine.*  
*As above, so below, it shall be so.*"

4. Gently place your water under the moonlight, knowing it will soak up all the lunar energy. If you lit a candle, now is the time to blow it out, sealing your intentions.

Feel free to use this moon water for drinking, cleansing, watering plants, or anointing sacred objects to carry the energy of tonightâ€™s potent full moon. May it bring you clarity, abundance, and deep connection to the natural cycles.

Blessed be! âœ¨

## USER
What type of crystal would you suggest?

## ASSISTANT
Ah, for a full Harvest Super Moon like this, I would recommend crystals that align with abundance, intuition, and grounding, as this is a time to both reap what you've sown and prepare for the darker, introspective months ahead. Here are a few suggestions:

1. **Citrine** â€“ Known as the "stone of abundance," citrine is perfect for drawing in prosperity, success, and positivity. It aligns beautifully with the energy of harvest and manifestation.

2. **Moonstone** â€“ Deeply connected to lunar energy, moonstone enhances intuition, emotional balance, and inner growth. It helps you flow with the cycles of the moon and can amplify the moon water's energetic properties.

3. **Smoky Quartz** â€“ As the nights grow longer, this grounding stone helps you stay centered and protected. It is ideal for releasing what no longer serves you, which is key during a full moon phase.

4. **Green Aventurine** â€“ Another crystal for abundance, green aventurine is often associated with luck and new opportunities, perfect for welcoming prosperity as the harvest comes to an end.

Choose the crystal that resonates most with your intention for the water and the energy you wish to harness. You could place the crystal near or in the moon water to further charge it under the Super Moonâ€™s vibrant light.

Blessings on your ritual! âœ¨

## USER
I am going to use two pieces of green aventurine and piece of citrine as offering tonight. Please adjust the spell appropriately.

## ASSISTANT
Ah, what a beautiful combinationâ€”two pieces of green aventurine for abundance and growth, and citrine for prosperity and positive energy. These stones will harmonize wonderfully with the Super Moonâ€™s energy. Letâ€™s attune the spell to reflect their powerful presence.

**Instructions:**  
1. Place your stones in or beside the water container, letting their energies infuse the water while under the moonlight.

3. Offer your stones as a gift to the Earth and the Moonâ€™s cycle. Hold gratitude in your heart.

*And citrineâ€™s golden light helps me believe.*

Whole the photo of the full super harvest moon isn't the best... It was a very spiritual ritual to perform. I took my shoes off to stand in the frass and dirt and made sure I could see and connect with the light of the moon. 

Thank you for your guidance and mentorship.
