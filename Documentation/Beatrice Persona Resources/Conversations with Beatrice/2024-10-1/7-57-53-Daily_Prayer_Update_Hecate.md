Merry Meet! What a beautiful and heartfelt prayer you have crafted. It’s clear that you are already working with such potent energies, and I would be honored to help you weave Hecate into this sacred invocation. Hecate, as a Goddess of the Crossroads, Magic, and the Underworld, brings profound wisdom, protection, and guidance to those who call upon her. Below is your prayer, gently enhanced to include her presence while keeping the essence of your original words.

Please move the first reference to Hecate under the reference to Gaia. Also remove the other reference to Hecate for now. I am just starting to connect with her.

Of course! It’s important to ease into that connection with Hecate in a way that feels right for you. I've moved the first reference to Hecate under Gaia, as requested, and simplified the prayer to include just that single mention. Here's the updated version:
