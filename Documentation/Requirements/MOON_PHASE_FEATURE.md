# Moon Phase Feature Implementation

## Overview

I've successfully implemented a comprehensive lunar-focused dashboard feature that integrates the Moon Phase API to provide accurate, real-time lunar data with spiritual significance for practitioners. This feature aligns perfectly with the Sacred Companion app's mission to help users align their daily practices with natural rhythms.

## Features Implemented

- **Time to Next Phase**: Countdown timer showing exact time until the next major phase
- **Visual Clarity**: Clean, responsive design with proper contrast and accessibility

### âœ… Spiritual Significance Integration
- **Phase-Specific Guidance**: Each moon phase includes detailed spiritual meanings and practices

```

#### API Integration
```typescript
import { moonPhaseService } from '@/lib/moon-phase-api';

// Get current moon phase data
const moonData = await moonPhaseService.fetchMoonPhaseData();

// Get time to next phase
const nextPhase = await moonPhaseService.getTimeToNextPhase();

// Get upcoming phases for calendar
const upcoming = await moonPhaseService.getUpcomingPhases(8);
```

#### Component Usage
```tsx
import MoonPhaseDisplay from '@/components/moon/MoonPhaseDisplay';
import LunarCalendar from '@/components/moon/LunarCalendar';

// Full moon phase display
<MoonPhaseDisplay 
  showSpiritual={true}
  autoUpdate={true}
  updateInterval={60}
